ICES secretariat collected during 2017 relevant VMS and logbook data for 2009-2016 to produce, as a technical service to HELCOM, updated spatial data layers on fishing intensity/pressure. Improved data quality control checks were implemented. Submitted data across the HELCOM area have improved in quality compared to previous data 2009-2013 published in 2015. Standardized methods were used to produce the requested data layers. The code used to create the data products is available here: https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGSFD

The BIAS surveys cover almost the whole area where sprat is commonly encountered. 
Outside BIAS area, sprat landings data was used to complement the data. 

For ICES rectangles surveyed by BIAS, values shown are the mean values per ICES rectangle based on BIAS data, average for 2011-2016. For ICES rectangles not surveyed by BIAS, values are calculated as: 
MAX-value x Weighting factor. The weighting factor is specific to each ICES rectangle, calculated as the ratio between the commercial landings in that rectangle and the commercial landings in the ICES rectangle with highest landings (based on averages for 2011-2015). MAX-value = millions of sprat according to BIAS in the ICES rectangle with highest landings.
ICES rectangles outside the BIAS survey area with no reported sprat landings were given the value 0.

The abundance values / ICES rectangle were divided by the area of the rectangle to obtain values per 1km2, and then converted to 1 km x 1km grid cells.

Values were first log transformed and then normalised."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This product shows the mean snow cover duration (SCDmean), which is updated each year and consists of the arithmetic mean for the entire time series since the hydrological year 2001. The hydrological year begins in the meteorological autumn (October 1 of the previous year in the northern hemisphere or March 1 of the reference year in the southern hemisphere) and ends with the meteorological summer (northern hemisphere: August 31 of the reference year; southern hemisphere: February 28/29 of the following year). Analogous to the annual products for snow cover duration, the entire year as well as the early season (until mid-winter) and the late season (from mid-winter) are taken into account here.
The “Global SnowPack” is derived from daily, operational MODIS snow cover product for each day since February 2000. Data gaps due to polar night and cloud cover are filled in several processing steps, which provides a unique global data set characterized by its high accuracy, spatial resolution of 500 meters and continuous future expansion. It consists of the two main elements daily snow cover extent (SCE) and seasonal snow cover duration (SCD; full and for early and late season). Both parameters have been designated by the WMO as essential climate variables, the accurate determination of which is important in order to be able to record the effects of climate change. Changes in the largest part of the cryosphere in terms of area have drastic effects on people and the environment.

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.I3L10, AA.J3L10, AB.I3L10 and AB.J3L10 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic or aphotic coarse sediment or sand dominated by multiple infaunal bivalve species: Macoma calcarea, Mya truncata, Astarte spp., Spisula spp. The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.I3L10, AA.J3L10, AB.I3L10 andAB.J3L10according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Kiel bight to Isle of Fehmarn, might occasionally occur in Mecklenburg Bight to Darss sill, South-westernBaltic Sea. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known tooccur.AA.I3L10, AA.J3L10, AB.I3L10 andAB.J3L10have been placed in the Red List classification to the category of Near Threatened (NT) biotopes.

-	Cables (under construction, 1 km buffer)
-	Coastal defence and flood protection (under construction, 500 m buffer)
-	Deposit of dredged material (500 m buffer for points and areas)
-	Dredging (maintenance) (500 m buffer for points and areas)

    dcterms:description """This dataset represents the underlying point data on core indicator Abundance of coastal fish key functional groups - cyprinids mesopredators. The core indicator evaluates the abundance of selected functional groups of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea. Quantitative thresholds are used to evaluate if core indicators status is Good, Not good or Not assessed. As a rule, good status is achieved when the abundance of piscivores (i.e. fish that feed on other fish) is above a site-specific threshold value, and the abundance of cyprinids or mesopredators (i.e. mid trophic-level fish) is within an acceptable range for the specific site. The status of functional groups of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea has been evaluated by assessing the status of piscivores and cyprinids/mesopredators during the period2011-2015.

This dataset displays the result of the indicator in HELCOM Assessment Scale 3 (Division of the Baltic Sea into 17 sub-basins and further division into coastal and offshore areas).

The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic.

Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface.

Estimated observations of the biotope 1170 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

ReefsThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1170 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The distribution map indicates the area in the 100x100 km grid where biotope is known to occur (Naturvårdverket 2011, EUNIS Database).(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

ICES secretariat collected during 2017 relevant VMS and logbook data for 2009-2016 to produce, as a technical service to HELCOM, updated spatial data layers on fishing intensity/pressure. Improved data quality control checks were implemented. Submitted data across the HELCOM area have improved in quality compared to previous data 2009-2013 published in 2015. Standardized methods were used to produce the requested data layers. The code used to create the data products is available here: https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGSFD

    dcterms:description """The MUIB consists of the compilation, harmonization, digitization and telematic dissemination of the urban planning of all the municipalities of the Balearic Islands.

MUIB IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It does not replace the need to consult the regulations approved and published by the competent Administration.

The project involves a systematization and harmonization of urban planning plans and instruments, the creation of a wide database of its parameters (with a single dictionary of urban concepts), the compilation and georeferencing of the planning plans, the digitization of these, as well as the creation of the entire geographic information system and the web map viewer to provide access to the plans and documentation in force or the creation of urban information sheets.
It should be noted that, although the cartography is a fusion of the categories of municipal and territorial planning, the related attributes may not take into account the determinations of territorial planning (especially island territorial plans), so the information on the attributes of the non-adapted municipalities can be partially or totally abrogated by these superior plans, especially in rustic.

The layers of geographic information that are part of the MUIB are:
-CLASSIFICACIÓ: layer that determines the structural organization of the territory by which the planning establishes a differentiated urban land regime. According to the urban legislation there are three types of land: urban, "urbanitzable" and rustic. IMPORTANT: the MUIB does not collect those "urbanitzable"  that can be into urban areas, MUIB shows how those are defined in the approval of the general planning of the municipality.
-QUALIFICACIÓ: layer that determines, both the structural and detailed planning, certain global or detailed uses of the land, indicating down to the minimum level the different areas that organize the urban and urbanizable land in order, delimiting the developable land not ordered and indicating the type of rustic soil (common or protected).
-CATEGORIES: layer that determines the structural organization of the territory by which the planning identifies to the minimum level the different areas that organize the rustic land and indicating the type of urban land.The layer of CATEGORIES in some cases only shows the categories defined by the municipal planning and, to know exactly the type of rustic ground, it is necessary to superimpose the rest of layers of arrangement and protection of the rustic ground of the Territorial Plans, Protected Natural Areas, etc. For example, a land may have the category "SR_proteg" in the MUIB, as it is the category assigned to it by municipal planning, but also be "AANP" in the Territorial Plan.
-SISTEMES: layer that contains the infrastructures and equipment destined to cover the urban demand of the population.
-APR_E: layer that delimits the erosion risk prevention areas in accordance with the determinations of the municipal regulations or the Territorial Plan for those that are not available or are not adapted.
-APR_I: layer that delimits the fire risk prevention areas in accordance with the determinations of the municipal regulations or higher regulation.
-APR_S: layer that delimits the areas of prevention of risk of landslides in accordance with the determinations of the municipal regulations or the Territorial Plan by those that are not available or are not adapted.
-APR_U: layer that delimits the flood risk prevention areas in accordance with the determinations of the municipal regulations or the Territorial Plan by those that are not available or are not adapted.
-APT: layer that delimits the areas of territorial protection in accordance with the determinations of the territorial and urban regulations
-APR_A: Aquifer Protection (only certain municipalities).

Downloadable layers are defined so that only current entities are downloaded (by means of the validity start (DINIVIGEN) and validity end (DFIVIGEN) fields), so that they do not have overlaps. The base data does include a temporary variable and therefore there are overlaps between the entities of the same layer.

Of the municipality of Ibiza, due to the annulment of the PGOU of 2009 and pending the final approval of the new Revision of the General Municipal Plan, the MUIB only shows some plans, partial plans and modifications, as it is not currently has the digitization of the current municipal planning is the PGOU, approved on December 10, 1987."""@en ;

Model results of the annual mean bottom current velocity (m/s). 

Description

This dataset shows model results of the annual mean bottom current velocity (m/s). Data source, NERI/Denmark. Currents in the sea can be generated by many different parameters, among which are: I. Tidal motion II. Wind stress III. Density difference due to differences in salinity or temperature IV. Seismic activity and motion of the earth In near shore regions, the wave-induced along shore currents are the dominating currents, whereas in offshore regions, a combination of tidal and meteorological forces is the dominating current generating parameters. Near the sea bottom the friction of the current flow forms a turbulent layer, termed boundary layer, over the seabed. The thickness of this layer ranges from few meters up to several tens of meters. Within this layer the current speed increases nonlinearly with the height above the seabed, being zero at the seabed and maximum at the top of the layer. The variation of the current speed with height above the seabed is called current velocity profile."""@en ;

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.M1Q2, AA.H1Q2, AA.I1Q2 and AA.J1Q2 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic mixed substrate, mud, coarse sediment or sand dominated by stable aggregations of unattached Fucus spp. (dwarf form) The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.M1Q2, AA.H1Q2, AA.I1Q2 andAA.J1Q2according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The Fucus spp. dwarf form is known from Sweden, Finland, Germany andEstonia. In all countries plusPoland also unattached Fucus spp. occurswidespread in sheltered areas. But it is not clear for each ofthose countries, ifthese unattached forms are built of the typical F. vesiculosus morphology, thedwarfform or both forms. In Poland the unattached Fucus biotope hasdisappeared from the Puck Lagoon, soit might be difficult to clear this question.Presently this biotope is only known to occur in Sweden andGermany. InGermany it exists only in very few coastal lagoons with low to moderateeutrophicationpressures and salinities of around 7–10 psu (Vitter Bodden,Kubitzer Bodden, Wieker Bodden.Distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur.AA.M1Q2, AA.H1Q2, AA.I1Q2 andAA.J1Q2have been placed in the Red List classification to the category of Critically Endangered (CR) biotopes.

The map was produced in 2014 in collaboration with, and co-funded by, The Crown Estate as part of a wider commissioned project to assess seabed geological constraints on engineering infrastructure across the UKCS. The divisions on the map combine the Quaternary deposits into 7 categories of similar strength and lithological variability, each with a ‘Category’ title that summarises their main lithological character: diamict; firm to hard interbedded (layered); firm to hard mud; sand and gravel; soft interbedded; soft mud; undifferentiated. These categories can be used as a basis for assessing, in conjunction with a range of other geological factors, the geological constraints on engineering structures at or close to the seabed.

In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia.

HELCOM secretariat did the following processing to the data:

-	Conversion to ETRS89LAEA coordinate system

It is operated on a Dornier Do-228 aircraft from altitudes of 2000 to 6000 m above ground in five different center frequency bands (X,C,S,L,P). Wavelengths range from 3 cm, 5 cm, 9 cm, 23 cm to 67 cm. Ka-band (1 cm wavelength) is planned to be added. Up to four center-frequencies (X,S,L,P) or (X,C,L,P) can be operated simultaneously per overflight. All frequencies are fully polarimetric (HH,HV,VV,VH) and have full repeat-pass capabilities. Single-pass interferometry in along-track (ATI) and across-track mode is available in X-band (ATI and/or XTI) and S-band (XTI). Data are processed up to three different levels: RGI (Radar Geometry Image product), INF (Repeat-pass-interferometric product) and GTC (Geocoded and Terrain-Corrected product). Resolutions range from 25 cm (X-band) to 1.5 m (P-band) in both azimuth and range direction. Data acquisition modes are typically “stripmap”, “repeat-pass” (two parallel tracks), “tomography” (several parallel tracks), ”circular” (one circle) or “circular-tomography” (several vertically distributed circles). Individually planned experiments can also be supported.

Estimated observations of the biotope 1130 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Estuaries The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1130 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Estuaries are present in the entire Baltic Sea area. Examples of river mouth areas in Denmark: Gudenåen-Randers Fjord, Horsens Fjord, Vejle Fjord, Kolding Fjord Sweden: Bräkneån, Hagbyån, Virån, Loftaån, Finland: Porvoonjoki river mouth area, Kymijoki river mouth area, Merikarvianjoki, Aurajoki river mouth area, Russia: Neva estuary, Germany: Trave estuary, Warnow estuary, Peene mouth area.

The area of the bubbles corresponds to the risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances. The unit of the risk is average tonnes per year. This dataset has been produced by Albrecht Lentz, COWI (http://www.cowi.dk) for the BRISK project (Sub-regional risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea, http://www.brisk.helcom.fi/). The dataset is a model result from a software code owned and operated by COWI. BRISK and BRISK-RU provide information on spatial distribution of risks of pollution from ships in the six sub-regions of the Baltic Sea, according to different types of accidents and spill sizes. The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic. Groundings and ship-to-ship collisions are by far the most likely types of accidents resulting in pollution. Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface. The effects of oil drift, weathering and fate, as well as the oil recovery are taken into account.

Estimated observations of the biotope AB.A1G4 and AB.M1G4 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic aphotic rock and boulders or mixed hard and soft substrates dominated by soft corals (Alcyonacea)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AB.A1G4 and AB.M1G4 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The biotopes occur in the Kattegat and Belt Sea on rocky substrates in exposed areas of high salinity. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotopes are estimated to occur based on environmental gradients and the availability of the specific substrate.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description "The expedition PS155/1 started on August 5th, 2018 in Tromsø (Norway) and ended in Longyearbyen (Spitsbergen) on September 3rd, 2018. In the course of BGR’s GREENMATE project the geological development of the European North Atlantic and the northern and north eastern Greenland shelf was analyzed using various marine geophysical methods (seismics, magnetics, gravity, heatflow measurements) and geological sampling (gravity corer, box corer, multi-corer, dredge). Sampling of marine Shelf sediments was undertaken in close correspondence with co-users from Geomar (add-on project ECHONEG), aiming to reconstruct Holocene paleo environmental and climatic evolution. Using the ship’s helicopters, marine sampling was complemented by onshore sampling operations to extract geological material at selected near coastal locations. Other scientific project groups used the cruise PS115.1 as an opportunity to quantify marine mammals and sea birds and their statistical distribution in our research area as part of the long-term project (add-on project Birds& Mammals) and to gather additional meteorological data via radiosondes (add-on Project YOPP). Against all expectations, outstanding ice conditions along the northern coast of Greenland enabled us to carry out reflection seismic surveys north of 84°N at the southern tip of Morris Jesup Rise with a 3 km long streamer. Structural data of this particular region of North Greenland is of special importance for BGR’s project GREENMATE for reconstructing the continental margin evolution. A 100 km long refraction seismic profile was measured to complement the reflection seismic data. After completing this, scientific work was concentrated on the northeastern Greenland shelf area between 76°N and 82.5°N. Over the time of the cruise a total of 2500 km of reflection seismic profiles (2250 km measured with 3km streamer length) and 100 km of refraction seismic profile (using nine ocean bottom seismometers) were measured, accompanied by gravity and magnetic surveys and seven heat flow measurement stations. Along the shelf and deep-sea area 21 geological sampling sites were chosen, with all together one dredge (around 200 kg of sample), 16 gravity cores (total core length 65 m), 12 box corers and 6 multi-corer stations. Onshore sediment sampling was done at 11 sampling sites. Beside sediment sampling hard rock from near coastal outcrops was collected in a total amount of 250 kg that will be used for age dating. The entire science program was carried out under consideration of the highest ecological standards to protect marine mammals and to meet all environmental requirements of the permitting authorities. In addition to external marine mammal observers (MMO) various acoustic monitoring systems and AWI’s on board infrared detection system AIMMS monitored any activity of marine mammals in the ships perimeter, especially during seismic operations."@en ;

In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use.

The operating area was the North Sea and Baltic Sea. The geophysical lines in the Baltic Sea were chosen as extended onshore DEKORP lines to evaluate the deep structure of the south western part of the Baltic Sea. For the seismic profiles a tuned source array consisting of 20 air guns in two linear strings with a total volume of 52 l was used. The recording length was 26 s, the sample rate 4 ms and the shot interval 30 s. This time triggering for the shot release was chosen, because all shots were also recorded onshore by seismic stations for wide angle/refraction acquisition (GFZ). During this leg 810 km reflection lines and additional 230 km pure shooting could be surveyed. The preliminary interpretation of the seismic single traces was restricted on the ship to the upper time range. The main structures in the southern Baltic Sea could be evaluated.

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential spawning areas for sprat was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Sprat (Sprattus sprattus) occurs in the entire Baltic Sea, and mainly in open sea areas. It is assessed as a single stock in the Baltic Sea within fisheries management. Sprat eggs are pelagic, and sprat spawning is well known from the deep basins in the central Baltic, where it typically occurs from February to August. Further north, spawning starts later in the year, and is less certain. Recent fisheries surveys indicate that sprat spawning does no longer occur in the Gulf of Finland. Sprat spawning areas were delineated using environmental variables due to lack of coherent field data across the Baltic Sea countries. “Potential sprat spawning areas” were delineated as areas with salinity > 6 and water depth > 30 m, but for the Arcona basin depth > 20 m was used (Grauman, 1980, Bauman et al. 2006, Voss et al. 2012). “High probability spawning areas” were delineated for areas deeper than 70 m. 

Stock: Sprat in subdivisions 22-32 (ICES)

EFH type: Potential spawning areas

Approach: Environmental envelope, corrected for areas 20-40 m south of Bornholm.

Variables and thresholds: Potential spawning area: Depth > 30 m, Salinity > 6 (annual average)
High probability spawning area: Depth >70 m, Salinity > 6 (annual average)

Quality: The map is based on literature and environmental variables, not actual data on sprat spawning. The map might overestimate the spawning area west and north of Gotland. The data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no spawning (0), potential spawning area (0.5) and high probability spawning area (1).

    dcterms:description """The Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) provides a new level of detail in global topographic data. Previously, the best available global DEM was GTOPO30 with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc-seconds. The GMTED2010 product suite contains seven new raster elevation products for each of the 30-, 15-, and 7.5-arc-second spatial resolutions and incorporates the current best available global elevation data. The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis. Metadata have also been produced to identify the source and attributes of all the input elevation data used to derive the output products. Many of these products will be suitable for various regional continental-scale land cover mapping, extraction of drainage features for hydrologic modeling, and geometric and radiometric correction of medium and coarse resolution satellite image data. The global aggregated vertical accuracy of GMTED2010 can be summarized in terms of the resolution and RMSE of the products with respect to a global set of control points (estimated global accuracy of 6 m RMSE) provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). At 30 arc-seconds, the GMTED2010 RMSE range is between 25 and 42 meters; at 15 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 29 and 32 meters; and at 7.5 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 26 and 30 meters. GMTED2010 is a major improvement in consistency and vertical accuracy over GTOPO30, which has a 66 m RMSE globally compared to the same NGA control points. In areas where new sources of higher resolution data were available, the GMTED2010 products are substantially better than the aggregated global statistics; however, large areas still exist, particularly above 60 degrees North latitude, that lack good elevation data. As new data become available, especially in areas that have poor coverage in the current model, it is hoped that new versions of GMTED2010 might be generated and thus gradually improve the global model.

EXPLORA within the Ross Sea on the second marine-geophysical expedition of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) to Antarctica, in total 6,745 km of magnetic, gravity and digital reflection seismic lines and additionally 1,400 km gravity lines were acquired in the period from January 10th to March 2nd 1980. On 43 stations sonobuoy refraction measurements have been carried out. The main results are: 
(1) In the eastern part of the Ross Sea Shelf two striking discontinuities have been identified in the reflection seismics representing gaps in the sediments at the turn-over of the Upper Miocene to the Pliocene (ca. 7 mio years B.P.) and between the Middle and Upper Miocene (ca. 11.5 mio. years B.P.) according to results of DSDP boreholes. 
(2) In the southern part of the Ross Sea Shelf the basement is uncovered at depths over 700m due to a thrust of the shelf ice recently.
(3) A structural unit extends alongside the meridian of 180° separating the Ross Sea into two different geologic regions. This unit is characterised by two basement highs with seismic velocities exceeding 5 km/sec.

Estimated observations of the biotope AB.A1J and AB.M1J were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic aphotic rock and boulders or mixed substrates dominated by sponges (Porifera)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AB.A1J and AB.M1J according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The sponge biotopes are distributed along the whole Baltic Sea coastline. But as aphotic stony bottoms are scarce in the South-western and Southern Baltic Sea the biotopes are distributed mainly along the Swedish, Danish, Estonian and Finnish coastline or at some offshore reefs. The higher the salinities, the higher the diversity of the sponges and due to the more erect growth also the diversity of the inhabiting invertebrate and fish communities. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotopes are known to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description "Advances in our understanding of the Earth's climate system will rely on our ability to link high-resolution sedimentary archives from the oceans, ice-cores and terrestrial sequences, and to interpret these records in the context of novel Earth system modeling approaches. Few places exist in the world where sufficiently detailed and unambiguous marine-ice-terrestrial linkages are possible. One challenge for IODP, and the broader drilling community in general, is to identify and recover marine, ice and terrestrial sequences from appropriate locations and with adequate temporal resolution to study processes of the integrated climate system. One such region is the southwest Iberian Margin where it has been demonstrated that the surface oxygen isotopic record could be correlated precisely to temperature variations (i.e., d18O) in Greenland ice cores. By comparison, the benthic d18O signal in the same core resembled the temperature record from Antarctica. Moreover, the narrow continental shelf and proximity of the Tagus River results in the rapid delivery of terrestrial material to the deep-sea environment off Portugal, thereby providing a record of atmospheric changes and permitting correlation of marine and ice core records to European terrestrial sequences. This is the only place in the ocean where such marine-ice-terrestrial correlations have been demonstrated unambiguously. It is therefore highly desirable to extend the Iberian Margin record to encompass the full range of Plio-Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles by drilling with the JOIDES Resolution (JR). Towards this end, Proposal 771-Full was submitted to IODP by an international group of 16 proponents led by the UK. The proposal was well received and reviewed by the Science Steering and Evaluation Panel (SSEP), but the IODP Site Survey Panel (SSP) identified major inadequacies in the quality of the seismic data: \"The panel raised several concerns on the suitability of the submitted data with regard to its appropriateness, both to image the target properly and with regard to the site location. The panel also discussed the need for 2 high-resolution lines and considered that places where Mass Transport Deposits (MTDs) or closely spaced faults were present deserved these 2 high-resolution lines.\" This proposal requests 25 days of ship time to collect the necessary seismic and sediment data needed to meet the SSP requirements and recommendations. Several \"stand-alone\" scientific objectives are also proposed related to the modern hydrography and sedimentary processes on the southwest Iberian Margin, and calibration of palaeoceanographic proxies used for reconstructing past changes in deep-water circulation. This value-added science will make effective use of ship time and contribute key information needed to interpret the downcore records to be obtained by IODP."@en ;

The modeled risk is calculated for the scenario year 2020 based on predicted shipping traffic density. The area of the bubbles corresponds to the risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances. The unit of the risk is average tonnes per year. This dataset has been produced by Albrecht Lentz, COWI (http://www.cowi.dk) for the BRISK project (Sub-regional risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea, http://www.brisk.helcom.fi/). The dataset is a model result from a software code owned and operated by COWI. BRISK and BRISK-RU provide information on spatial distribution of risks of pollution from ships in the six sub-regions of the Baltic Sea, according to different types of accidents and spill sizes. The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic. Groundings and ship-to-ship collisions are by far the most likely types of accidents resulting in pollution. Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface. The effects of oil drift, weathering and fate, as well as the oil recovery are taken into account.

For ICES rectangles surveyed by BIAS, values shown are the mean values per ICES rectangle based on BIAS data, average for 2011-2016. For ICES rectangles not surveyed by BIAS, values are calculated as: 
MAX-value x Weighting factor. The weighting factor is specific to each ICES rectangle, calculated as the ratio between the commercial landings in that rectangle and the commercial landings in the ICES rectangle with highest landings (based on averages for 2011-2016). MAX-value = millions of herring according to BIAS in the ICES rectangle with highest landings.
ICES rectangles outside the BIAS survey area with no reported herring landings were given the value 0.

The relative abundance values in each ICES rectangle were divided by the area of the rectangle to obtain values per 1km2. If the values in small coastal ICES rectangles (outside BIAS area) became unrealistically large due to high herring landings, the value of the neighboring rectangle was given.

Model results for the distribution of where at least 1% available light touches the seabed (the photic zone) and non-photic zone in the Baltic Sea based on 1% mean annual irradiance

Description

This dataset shows model results forthe distribution of where at least 1% available light touches the seabed (the photic zone) and non-photic zone in the Baltic Sea based on 1% mean annual irradiance. From an ecological point of view, available light is one of the primary physical parameters influencing and structuring the biological communities in the marine environment, as it is the driving force behind the primary production by providing the energy for the photosynthesis - energy that ultimately is transferred to other organisms not capable of photosynthesis. The depth of the photic zone is traditionally defined, for benthic plants, as the depth where 1% of the surface irradiance (as measured just below the water surface) is available for photosynthesis. Only two intervals based on light regime were used in the dataset, because they reflect the significant ecological difference between the shallow water depth with the presence of submerged aquatic vegetation, and the deeper waters where fauna (and bacteria) dominate diversity of species, abundance, and biomass. The intervals are: I. The photic zone (where at least 1% of the available light touches the seabed). II. The non-photic zone.The measurements of Secchi Depth used for producing this dataset are not evenly distributed and some areas in the Baltic Proper, Gulf of Riga and southern Baltic are not well covered."""@en ;

    dcterms:description "Although the terrestrial mantle comprises ~80 vol.% of our planet, its compositional architecture is not well understood despite the importance such knowledge holds for constraining Earth's thermal and chemical evolution over ~4.5 billion years of geological time. Our lack of detailed insight into the mantle stems in part from the fact that it is rarely exposed at our planets surface, making direct observation and study difficult. It is clear from recent study, however, that the mantle cannot be assumed to be compositionally homogenous or static over geological time. Peridotites from the ocean basins (abyssal peridotites) and from ophiolites preserve evidence for a convecting upper mantle that is chemically and isotopically heterogeneous at regional (100's km) and small (cm-to-m) scales. Complex formation and alteration upper mantle histories involving processes of melt-depletion, refertilisation (whereby originally refractory residues such as harzburgites become lherzolites again via melt addition) and melt-rock reaction have been held responsible, but the causes, timing and distribution of such processes are poorly resolved. Ophiolites, which represent partially-to-wholly preserved slivers of obducted oceanic mantle, are particularly valuable resources for assessing the timing, causes and extent of mantle heterogeneity, as they allow field-based observation to be coupled with geochemical investigation on otherwise inaccessible mantle material. Furthermore, ophiolites preserve a range of oceanic mantle lithologies (e.g., harzburgites, lherzolite and dunite) and such variation allows detailed assessment of the distribution and relative timing of events acting upon the mantle that is preserved. A distinctive attribute of some ophiolites, which contrasts with abyssal peridotites, is the presence of podiform chromitite seams, typically in the region of the petrological Moho, which are often associated with Platinum-group element mineralization. The timing and genesis of ophiolite podiform chromitites is controversial, but it has been suggested that they represent zones of focused melt channeling in supra-subduction zone settings. The Shetland (UK) and Leka (Norway) supra-subduction zone ophiolites comprise oceanic lithosphere separated at ~620 Ma on either side of a mid-ocean ridge and subsequently obducted over continental crust ~130 Ma later, each on opposite sides of the northern Iapetus Ocean. A pilot study already carried out on the Shetland ophiolite by the PI and Project Partner reveals that it preserves evidence for a complex sequence of melt depletion, percolation and refertilisation events that occurred over the lifetime of the Iapetus mantle. The critical observation made from the pilot dataset is that later mantle events only partially overprint the compositional heterogeneities developed from earlier mantle processes and that the relatively high degrees of partial melting associated with the supra-subduction zone are very effective at generating such heterogeneity. This important observation will be tested in the proposed research by 1) extending the Shetland study to greater levels of detail; 2) inclusion of a comparative study of carefully selected samples from the well-preserved Leka ophiolite; 3) drawing comparisons with existing geochemical and isotopic datasets from ophiolites that formed in other (e.g., mid-ocean ridge) tectonic settings. In order to achieve this, the powerful combination of the Re-Os isotopic system and highly-siderophile element (Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Re, Au) abundance measurements will be utilised to discriminate between the processes responsible for generating mantle heterogeneities such as melt depletion, refertilisation and melt-rock reaction. Thus, profound insight will be gained into the chemical evolution of a piece of oceanic mantle and the development of compositional heterogeneity therein, from outcrop to oceanic plate scales, over much of the lifetime of the Iapetus Ocean."@en ;

For perch, species distribution modelling studies (Snickars et al. 2010, Bergström et al. 2013, Sundblad et al. 2013) have shown the importance of suitable environmental conditions for reproduction. Due to lack of coherent data on perch spawning and nursery areas across the Baltic Sea countries, environmental variables were used in delineating potential recruitment areas for perch. The distribution area or perch recruitment is delineated by selecting areas where depth < 4 m (For Danish waters < 3 m), logged exposure < 5 (exposure model described in Isæus 2004), and salinity < 10 PSU. The threshold values have been obtained from literature (Snickars et al. 2010, Bergström et al. 2013, Skovrind et al. 2013, Sundblad et al. 2013). Relatively “loose” thresholds have been used, to rather overestimate than underestimate the recruitment area (precautionary approach).

Marine seabed sediment split into 5 categories in the Kattegat and Baltic Sea (compiled from sediment information from GEUS, GSF and SGU). 

Description

Marine seabed sediment split into 5 categories in the Kattegat and Baltic Sea (compiled from sediment information from GEUS, GSF and SGU). The sediment composition of the seabed is considered essential in marine landscape production as it is one of the primary parameters influencing the biogeographic distribution of marine benthic species and a primary component in shaping the physical structure and function of marine habitats. The resulting classification scheme consists of five sediment classes, which can be extracted from existing data. The sediment classes applied in the mapping and modelling of the Baltic Sea marine landscapes are: I. Bedrock. II. Hard bottom complex, includes patchy hard surfaces and coarse sand (sometimes also clay) to boulders. III. Sand including fine to coarse sand (with gravel exposures). IV. Hard clay sometimes/often/possibly exposed or covered with a thin layer of sand/gravel. V. Mud including gyttja-clay to gyttja-silt.

    dcterms:description """Summary

Estimated observations of the biotope 1180 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Submarine structures made by leaking gasesThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1180 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Shallow water examples of “bubbling reefs” colonised by macroalgae and/or animals are observed in Danish waters in the littoral and sublittoral zone from 0 to 30 m water depth. They are present in the northern Kattegat and in the Skagerrak and follow a NW SE direction parallel to the Fennoscandian fault line. Distribution map indicates the 10x10 km grid cells where the biotope complex is known to occur. More specific knowledge of the distribution of the biotope complex allowed its presentation on a higher resolution grid (Seffel 2010, EUNIS Database). If the occurrence had been presented in the 100x100 km grid used for the other biotope complexes, then the squares 11, 9, 20 and 18 had been indicated.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This core indicator evaluates the abundance of selected functional groups of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea. Quantitative thresholds are used to classify core indicators status in "Achieve", "Fail" or "Not assessed". As a rule, good status is achieved when the abundance of piscivores (i.e. fish that feed on other fish) is above a site-specific threshold value, and the abundance of cyprinids or mesopredators (i.e. mid trophic-level fish) is within an acceptable range for the specific site. The status of functional groups of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea has been evaluated by assessing the status of piscivores and cyprinids/mesopredators during the period 2011-2016.

This dataset displays the result of the indicator for piscivores in HELCOM Assessment Scale 3 (Division of the Baltic Sea into 17 sub-basins and further division into coastal and offshore areas).

Estimated observations of the biotope 1140 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tideThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1140 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Mudflats and sandflats not covered by sea water at low tide occur in all parts of the Baltic Sea area, but patterns and descriptions of their distribution are mostly missing. In the Lahemaa area (Southern Gulf of Finland) for example, they are representing 3% of all habitats and also in the German Baltic Sea region they form a very narrow strip along some the coastlines. No information is available on their historical distribution. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur (Naturvårdverket 2011, EUNIS Database).(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

HELCOM requires spatially explicit information on fishing activity affecting the Baltic Sea marine ecosystem for policy purposes. In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia were not received. ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

HELCOM secretariat did the following processing to the data:

-	Conversion to ETRS89LAEA coordinate system

Within this continental margin segment multichannel reflection seismic measurements were carried out in parallel with magnetic and gravimetric measurements on 22 lines with a total length of 4,378 km during the period from January 20th to February 13th 1984, with the research objectives: i) to collect new geophysical data for a better understanding of magmatic-volcanic and tectonic processes during the initial drifting phase, and ii) to search for suitable positions for deep drilling sites of the \"Ocean Drilling Programme\" in the transition zone between continental and oceanic crust. A distinct and sharp reflection seismic boundary running from about 31°30'N/11°W in the south to 34°30'N/10°25'W in the north separates flat-lying Mesozoic sediments overlying slightly structured basement of the Jurassic \"Magnetic Quiet Zone\" from the complex Moroccan piercement zone in the east. A prominent magnetic anomaly, called S1, is nearly coincident with the sharp reflection seismic boundary, and is thought to represent most probably the initial drifting zone. The Moroccan piercement zone is interpreted to represent the eastern part of a pre-Jurassic rift-basin which conjugated western part lies off Nova Scotia/Canada. Subsidence associated with small-scale rotational block-faulting was time-transgressive in the Moroccan piercement zone, e.g. it started in Triassic time in the central part of the rift-basin and affected successively its landward parts apparently due to successively cooling of the stretched and thinned crust. Weak magnetic anomalies trending approximately NE-SW were recorded within the Jurassic \"Magnetic Quiet Zone\" lying west of magnetic anomaly S1. These anomalies can be correlated over distances of up to 300 km. They are interpreted to represent either variations of the geomagnetic field intensity or field reversals during a time of weak geomagnetic field."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The 5km Hex GS Shrink Swell dataset shows a generalised view of the GeoSure Shrink Swell v7 dataset to a hexagonal grid resolution of 64.95km coverage area (side length of 5km). This dataset indicates areas of potential ground movement in a helpful and user-friendly format. The rating is based on a highest level of susceptibility identified within that Hex area: Low (1), Moderate (2), Significant (3). Areas of localised significant rating are also indicated. The summarising process via spatial statistics at this scale may lead to under or over estimation of the extent of a hazard. The supporting GeoSure reports can help inform planning decisions and indicate causes of subsidence. The Shrink Swell methodology is based on the BGS Digital Map (DiGMapGB-50) and expert knowledge of the behaviour of the formations so defined. This dataset provides an assessment of the potential for a geological deposit to shrink and swell. Many soils contain clay minerals that absorb water when wet (making them swell), and lose water as they dry (making them shrink). This shrink-swell behaviour is controlled by the type and amount of clay in the soil, and by seasonal changes in the soil moisture content (related to rainfall and local drainage). The rock formations most susceptible to shrink-swell behaviour are found mainly in the south-east of Britain. Clay rocks elsewhere in the country are older and have been hardened by burial deep in the earth and are less able to absorb water. The BGS has carried out detailed geotechnical and mineralogical investigations into rock types known to shrink, and are modelling their properties across the near surface. This research underpins guidance contained in the national GeoSure dataset, and is the basis for our responses to local authorities, companies and members of the public who require specific information on the hazard in their areas. The BGS is undertaking a wide-ranging research programme to investigate this phenomenon by identifying those areas most at risk and developing sustainable management solutions.

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential recruitment areas for perch was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Perch (Perca fluviatilis) is a key species in many Baltic coastal areas. It is of freshwater origin and spawns predominantly in freshwater tributaries, close to the coastline, or in enclosed bays. Species distribution modelling have shown the importance of suitable environmental conditions for perch reproduction. Young perch has limited dispersal from its spawning area, and tagging studies have shown that most (50-95 % of the recaptures of perch are made up to 20 km from tagging site (Johnsson 1978, Böhling and Lehtonen 1985, Veneranta et al. 2011, Saks et al. 2020). Due to lack of coherent data on perch spawning and nursery areas across the Baltic Sea countries, environmental variables were used in delineating potential recruitment areas for perch. The map was originally developed within the HOLAS II project (HELCOM 2018) when it was approved by all HELCOM Contracting Parties in a dedicated review process. Potential perch recruitment areas were delineated as areas with suitable condition of depth, wave exposure and salinity. Thresholds were obtained from literature, and selected to rather overestimate than underestimate the recruitment area. For the Finnish coastline, a national model was used. The map was subsequently considered by the Pan Baltic Scope project, who proposed adjustments to thresholds for some areas in Russian waters, and corrections to Estonian and German waters.

Stock: Several, undefined

EFH type: Recruitment areas

Approach: Environmental window, national modelling approach in Finnish waters, supplemented with corrections to Estonian, German and Russian waters based on national validation with monitoring data.

Variables and thresholds: Depth < 4 m (for Danish waters < 3 m), Logged exposure < 5 (For Koporo Bay and Narva Bay in Russian waters < 5.23), Salinity < 10. Based on the model for the Finnish coastline, perch recruitment areas were defined as: Unsuitable for reproduction: P(catch larvae) < 0.5, Suitable for reproduction: P(catch larvae) > 0.5, Important for reproduction: the smallest area where the expected cumulative larval abundance is 80% of the total expected abundance over study area.

Quality: Recruitment area here refers to essential habitats for young-of-the-year perch (based on inventory data from spawning until the end of the first summer). The map is based on literature and environmental variables, derived from inventory data. The species distribution modelling studies, where the thresholds values for environmental variables have been obtained, are from the northern Baltic Sea. Here, the same thresholds have been applied in the southern Baltic. Also, the data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling. Due to these constraints, the data layer should be considered as a rough estimation.

Attribute information: Raster value representing the potential occurrence of perch recruitment area (either 0 or 1).

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential spawning areas for cod was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Cod (Gadus morhua) is represented by three stocks in the Baltic Sea; Eastern Baltic, Western Baltic and Kattegat cod, which is reflected in the map. “Potential spawning areas” were initially delimitated based on Hüssy (2011). In addition, the Gdansk deep as delineated by Bagge et al. (1994) was included as it sometimes contributes to reproduction of Eastern Baltic cod (Hinrichsen et al. 2016). The Gotland basin has ceased to contribute to the reproduction of cod (Hinrichsen et al. 2016). These definitions were applied in the HOLAS II project (HELCOM 2018a) based on approval by all HELCOM Contracting Parties in a review process (there referred to as ‘occasional successful spawning’ and ‘successful spawning’). Following HELCOM (2018b) additional potential spawning areas were identified by environmental thresholds for egg development and survival based on salinity and oxygen conditions (Hinrichsen et al. 2016) during 2011-2016. Separate thresholds were used for Eastern Baltic, Western Baltic and Kattegat cod. Areas denoted “high probability spawning areas” correspond to where the initial delineations (Hüssy 2011, Bagge et al. 1994) achieve the environmental threshold values.

Stocks: Kattegat cod: ICES subdivision 21, Western Baltic cod: ICES subdivisions 22-24 Eastern Baltic cod: ICES subdivisions 24 + 25-32

EFH type: Potential spawning areas

Approach: Literature review combined with identification of environmental window for spawning based on: salinity and oxygen for Eastern Baltic cod, and on: salinity and depth for Western Baltic Cod and Kattegat cod

Variables and thresholds: Eastern Baltic cod: Salinity > 11, Oxygen > 1.5 ml/L (annual average)
Western Baltic cod and Kattegat cod: Salinity > 18,  Depth >20 m

Quality: The Arkona deep is functional for spawning of both the Eastern and the Western Baltic cod and in effect, the definition of the Arcona Basin as a high probability areas in the Arkona basin reflect the result for Eastern Baltic cod.
The effective distribution of cod spawning areas is highly dependent on the prevailing hydrological regime, and the presence of spawning also depends on seasonally variable hydrographical conditions, such as temperature, salinity and oxygen. Seasonal differences lead to a progressive spawning season towards the east, typically starting in Kattegat and the Sound in January/February and ending in July/August in the Bornholm area. Fluctuations in temperature can delay the spawning season up to two months.
It is difficult to collect egg samples to verify cod spawning, as cod eggs may drift in deep areas, and instead the level of ichthyoplankton is a main source for estimation of good environmental conditions for cod spawning. Modelling based on ichthyoplankton should be validated by comparison with distribution of running adults, to resolve the potential influence of prevailing current speed. The proposed delineations are also influenced by research on the maturity of adults and histology of gonads. 
The adult and juvenile cod are distributed far outside of the spawning areas depicted in the map.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no spawning (0), potential spawning area (0.5) and high probability spawning area (1).

This dataset is for Ringed seal. Good status is achieved for each species when the abundance of seals in each management unit is at least 10,000 individuals and the species-specific growth rate is achieved. Harbour seals in the southwestern Baltic and the Kattegat form a metapopulation, where subpopulations are genetically connected. The combined sizes of the subpopulations are here used to evaluate the Limit Reference level (LRL).

The status evaluation is presented separately for the three seal species. The grey seal in the Baltic proper is evaluated as a single unit, whereas the Kattegat grey seals are evaluated separately. The status of ringed seals is evaluated for two management units. The status of harbour seals is evaluated for three management units.

Probability of detection was modelled using General Additive Modelling and static covariates such as depth, topographic complexity, month, spatial coordinates and with time surveyed as a weight. Monthly predictions were done on a 1x1 km grid and averaged to result in seasonal distribution maps for May – Oct and Nov – Apr.

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential nursery areas for flounders was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

The two flounder species in the Baltic Sea (Platichthys flesus and P. solemdali) have different reproductive strategies, spawning in the pelagic and in shallow waters, respectively. However, they utilize the same type nursery habitat. For both species, young of the year are found on shallow bottoms from June to September, primarily on sandy substrates. Flounder nursery areas were predicted by a generalized additive model with flounder abundance as response variable and seven map-based predictor variables. The model was based on data from available surveys of juvenile flounder in the Baltic Sea, compiled within the Pan Baltic Scope project (see HELCOM 2018a). To represent the nursery season and the current situation, only results from surveys performed in June-September during 2004-2018 were used, resulting in totally 2,114 samples. All abundance estimates were harmonized to numbers of juvenile flounder per square meter. Values for the predictor variables were extracted for each sampling point in GIS. The following environmental variables were used: salinity, wave exposure, water depth, slope of the bottom, surface temperature, bottom currents, and distance to high probability spawning area for European flounder.

Stock: Baltic flounder: ICES subdivisions 26, 28 (East of Gotland and Gulf of Gdansk), and 27, 29-32 (Northern Central Baltic Sea and Northern Baltic Sea). European flounder: ICES subdivisions 22-23 (Belt Sea and the Sound), and 24-25 (West of Bornholm and Southern Central Baltic Sea).).

EFH type: Nursery areas

Approach: Species distribution modelling 

Variables and thresholds: High probability nursery areas represent areas with a predicted abundance > 0.03 juvenile flounder/m² based on the applied data sets and model. Potential nursery areas represent predicted abundance levels between 0,0001 and 0,03 juvenile flounder/m². Areas with a predicted abundance < 0.0001 juvenile flounders/m² are defined as not being flounder nursery areas.

Quality: Data on juvenile flounder abundances to support the spatial model is missing from Denmark, Germany, Poland and Russia. Predictions are uncertain in these areas, and especially along the south coast of the Baltic Sea. 
The mix of data from different years, months and gear types may have contributed to increasing the variability in the dataset, even though a relatively high deviance explained by the model (41%) shows that it has predictive power.
The spatial resolution of the predictor variables varies between 200 m and 2 km, which gives coarse predictions locally even though values are representative at an overall regional scale.
The prediction is limited by a lack of accurate spatial information on surface sediments. Sandy substrates are well known as important flounder nursery habitats. Unfortunately, the only available sediment map on a Baltic Sea wide scale was too inaccurate for shallow waters where juvenile flounder occurs and was therefore excluded from the model.
The map on flounder nursery areas does not make assumptions on species identity in any area.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no nursery area (0), potential nursery area (0.5) and high probability nursery area (1). -999 indicates No data.

Description

Baltic Sea aphotic pelagic below halocline oxicThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AE.O5 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur. The habitat only makes up a section of the pelagic water mass in the area indicated by the map. The map is created based on the bathymetric data of the Baltic Proper. According to the depth contours, the grid indicated on the map include areas deeper than 60-80m.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

ICES secretariat collected during 2017 relevant VMS and logbook data for 2009-2016 to produce, as a technical service to HELCOM, updated spatial data layers on fishing intensity/pressure. Improved data quality control checks were implemented. Submitted data across the HELCOM area have improved in quality compared to previous data 2009-2013 published in 2015. Standardized methods were used to produce the requested data layers. The code used to create the data products is available here: https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGSFD

For further technical information on the advice request, see http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2017/Special_requests/helcom.2017.18.pdf

    dcterms:description "This dataset encompasses thin section photographs, mineral composition data and Ar/Ar data. Grant abstract: Many of the Earth's great mountain ranges, such as the Alps and the Himalaya, result from the collision between two continents. As mountains get pushed up by tectonic forces, they also get worn away by surface erosion. The uplift of topography causes long-term regional and global climate change, and conversely, changes in climate have also been linked to changes in the rate of tectonic processes. This project will define and quantify the competition between growth and erosion during the early stages of mountain uplift by exploiting a combination of state-of the art advances in numerical modelling and analytical techniques. During the early stages of continental collision, unusual (and diagnostic) rock types form under very high pressure conditions. Certain minerals in these rocks preserve details of the pressures and temperatures experienced during the journey from initial formation deep in the mantle, through their subsequent transport to the Earth's surface, their erosion, and their final deposition as sand grains in a sedimentary rock. The minerals retain distinctive chemical signatures which allows them to be distinguished from those formed in other rock types, even when eroded and turned into sand. Sand grains retain information about not only the original rock type, but also about details of the formation and transport history of the original rock. Unlocking this information will therefore yield insight into earlier stages of mountain belt growth history than is currently preserved in the bedrock record. However the methods needed to decipher these details are currently insufficiently precise to provide useful insight into changes in rates of tectonic or erosive processes, or constraints for the models. This project will therefore also develop and exploit innovative techniques for obtaining high-precision data from these high pressure rocks and their eroded remains. These data will enable the competing forces which act to shape a mountain belt during the early stages of formation to be quantified and allow the numerical models to be robustly tested. The unique contribution of this proposal lies in the combination of geodynamic numerical modelling with studies based on observational data and hence exploiting the synergy between these two, normally disparate, fields."@en ;

In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia were not received. ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

HELCOM secretariat did the following processing to the data:

-	Conversion to ETRS89LAEA coordinate system

-	Added feature and attribute "Reported" to display unreported areas. 

Dataset attribute information:

c-square: Unique reference of the c-square polygon

mid_lat: latitude coordinate of the centroid of c-square inWGS84 decimal degrees

Estimated observations of the biotope AB.H3N1 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic aphotic muddy sediment dominated by Monoporeia affinisand /or Pontoporeia femorataThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AB.H3N1 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur based on field sampling data. While it is the dominant biotope in the deep muddy areas of the Baltic Proper, it only occasionally occurs in the southern Baltic as the communities are most often dominated by bivalve or large polychaet species.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

Some of them were launched from the ISS. Therefore, on-orbit capacity is constantly improving in capability or quantity. Each Dove satellite is a CubeSat with a size of 10 x 10 x 34 cm. The complete PlanetScope constellation of approximately 130 satellites is able to image the entire land surface of the Earth every day, equating to a daily collection capacity of 200 million km².

In 2014 the first Dove satellites started operationally acquiring images from the earth’s surface. The optical sensors mounted on the individual Dove satellites operate in the visual and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum with a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 meters. A third generation of PlanetScope sensors (known as SuperDove or PSB.SD) is currently in orbit and is producing limited quantities of imagery with 5 spectral bands (BGRNIR + Red Edge). These satellites have the potential to produce imagery with 8 separate spectral bands. The PlanetScope data of this collection has been purchased by the German Space Agency with funds from the Ministry of Economy and is available for Germany-based researchers for scientific use. The data collection is maintained by the German Satellite Data Archive (D-SDA) of DLR’s Earth Observation Center and can be accessed via the EOWEB Geoportal.

This collection comprises PlanetScope L1B Basic Scene 3-band natural color RGB products. The PlanetScope Basic Scene product is a Scaled Top of Atmosphere Radiance (at sensor) and sensor corrected product, providing imagery as seen from the spacecraft without correction for any geometric distortions inherent in the imaging process.

Some of them were launched from the ISS. Therefore, on-orbit capacity is constantly improving in capability or quantity. Each Dove satellite is a CubeSat with a size of 10 x 10 x 34 cm. The complete PlanetScope constellation of approximately 130 satellites is able to image the entire land surface of the Earth every day, equating to a daily collection capacity of 200 million km².

In 2014 the first Dove satellites started operationally acquiring images from the earth’s surface. The optical sensors mounted on the individual Dove satellites operate in the visual and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum with a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 meters. A third generation of PlanetScope sensors (known as SuperDove or PSB.SD) is currently in orbit and is
producing limited quantities of imagery with 5 spectral bands (BGRNIR + Red Edge). These satellites have the potential to produce imagery with 8 separate spectral bands. The RapidEye Science Archive (RESA), which allows Germany-based researchers to apply for free PlanetScope imagery, is operated by the German Satellite Data Archive (D-SDA) of DLR’s Earth Observation Center and can be accessed via the EOWEB Geoportal. New PlanetScope data as well as archive data which is not yet part of the RESA collections can be applied for at Planet Labs Germany GmbH under the RESA contract.

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential recruitment areas for pikeperch was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is a species of freshwater origin, which spawns predominantly in freshwater tributaries and has a relatively limited dispersal away from its recruitment area. Species distribution modelling studies have shown the importance of suitable environmental conditions for pikeperch recruitment. Due to lack of coherent data on pikeperch spawning and nursery areas across the Baltic Sea countries, the distribution of pikeperch recruitment areas was delineated based on areas with suitable conditions of depth, wave exposure, salinity, water transparency (Secchi depth) and distance to deeper (10 m) waters. The threshold values were obtained from literature. Temperature, although important for pikeperch, was left out due to high variation in timing of suitable spawning temperatures across the Baltic Sea. The map on pikeperch recruitment areas was originally developed within the HOLAS II project (HELCOM 2018) when it was approved by all HELCOM Contracting Parties in a dedicated review process after correction to Swedish waters. The map was subsequently considered by the Pan Baltic Scope project, who proposed adjustments to Estonian, German, Lithuanian and Polish waters. 

Stock: Several, undefined

EFH type: Recruitment areas

Approach: Environmental window with national approach for Finnish waters, selected data points corrected for Estonian, German, Lithuanian, Polish, and Swedish waters.

Variables and thresholds: Depth < 5 m, Logged exposure < 5,  Salinity <  7, Secchi depth < 2, Distance to deep (10m) water < 4km. Based on the model for the Finnish coastline, pikeperch recruitment areas were defined as: Unsuitable for reproduction: P(catch larvae) < 0.5, Suitable for reproduction: P(catch larvae) > 0.5, Important for reproduction: the smallest area where the expected cumulative larval abundance is 80% of the total expected abundance over study area.

Quality: Recruitment area here refers to essential habitats for young-of-the-year pikeperch (based on inventory data from spawning until the end of the first summer). The map is based on literature and environmental variables, derived from inventory data. The species distribution modelling studies, where the thresholds values for environmental variables have been obtained, are from the northern Baltic Sea. Also, the data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling. Here, same thresholds have been applied in the southern Baltic. Due to these constraints, the data layer should be considered as a rough estimation. In addition, temperature is important for pikeperch recruitment but was not included as a delineating variable due to high variation in timing. The data layer may underestimate pikeperch in Finnish waters with respect to habitats for young-of-the-year pikeperch, as it focused on newly-hatched larvae when the dispersal is more limited compared to later in the season.

Attribute information: Raster value representing the potential occurrence of pikeperch reproduction area (either 0 or 1).

Description

Baltic photic muddy sediment or sand dominated by spiny naiad (Najas marina)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.H1B5 and AA.J1B5 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The Najas biotopes are distributed along the whole Baltic Sea coastline. Especially some very sheltered, oligohaline German Boddens, the Puck, Vistula and Curonian Lagoon, as well as Finnish and Swedish flads and glo-flads are typical localities where the biotopes occur. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotopes are known to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential spawning areas for Baltic flounder was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Baltic flounder (Platichthys solemdali) is a key species in many coastal areas of the Baltic Sea. It is the only endemic fish species of the Baltic Sea. Baltic flounder spawns in shallow coastal areas and on offshore banks, with eggs developing on the sea floor. Successful spawning may be expected at salinities down to around 5-7 (Nissling et al. 2002). ‘‘Potential spawning areas’ were initially delineated by a species distribution model (Orio et al. 2017) developed based on years 1993-1997 to consider a period with relatively better oxygen conditions, but applied with more recent data (2011-2014). The area was further delineated to encompass only areas shallower than 30 m in order to represent the demersal spawning habitat. ‘High probability spawning areas’ were identified as the sub-section encompassing salinity > 6. It should be noted that flounders in the Baltic Sea were recently separated into two species, and that spawning areas of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) are described separately. The two data layers do not overlap and can be combined to obtain a map on spawning areas for both flounder species taken together. 

Stocks: ICES identifies two stocks of Baltic flounder: ICES subdivisions 26, 28 (East of Gotland and Gulf of Gdansk), and 27, 29-32 (Northern Central Baltic Sea and Northern Baltic Sea).

EFH Type: Spawning areas

Approach: Species distribution modelling combined with identification of environmental salinity window and depth conditions for spawning, supplemented with additional information from monitoring in Estonian waters.

Variables and thresholds: Depth < 30 m, Salinity > 6

Quality: The data layer is based on species distribution modelling focusing on mature flounder at the spawning stage and should be considered a rough estimation. 
The data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling. Other variables than those tested in the model may also be influential.
The studies from which the thresholds values for environmental variables have been obtained are based on publications conducted before the separation of Baltic flounder from European flounder but have taken the specific characteristics of the separate spawning ecotypes into account.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no spawning (0), potential spawning area (0.5) and high probability spawning area (1).

The modeled risk is calculated for the scenario year 2020 based on predicted shipping traffic density. The area of the bubbles corresponds to the risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances. The unit of the risk is average tonnes per year. This dataset has been produced by Albrecht Lentz, COWI (http://www.cowi.dk) for the BRISK project (Sub-regional risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea, http://www.brisk.helcom.fi/). The dataset is a model result from a software code owned and operated by COWI. BRISK and BRISK-RU provide information on spatial distribution of risks of pollution from ships in the six sub-regions of the Baltic Sea, according to different types of accidents and spill sizes. The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic. Groundings and ship-to-ship collisions are by far the most likely types of accidents resulting in pollution. Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface. The effects of oil drift, weathering and fate, as well as the oil recovery are taken into account.

This dataset was compiled by Finnish Meteorological Institute (http://en.fmi.fi/) based on weather service observations on sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea from satellite observations (2005-2009). The minimum ice extent map displays the area which was covered by ice in every year of the study period. The maps were derived by digitizing existing ice extent maps to picture format and then to GIS shapefiles. Due to this reason the ice extent area should be considered as indicative especially within coastal areas. For further information, see http://www.iceservice.fi/."""@en ;

Description
Baltic photic or aphotic rock and boulders or mixed substrate dominated by erect moss animals (Flustra foliacea)
The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.

Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. 
This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.A1H2, AB.A1H2, AA.M1H2 andAB.M1H2according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:
The Flustra foliacea dominated biotope commonly occurs from Kattegat to the Mecklenburg Bight andArkona Basin (Kadetrinne). The spatial restriction to the Western Baltic Sea is due to the salinityrequirements of the dominant species Flustra foliacea. The more to the west or north-west this biotopeoccurs the higher the salinities, and in consequence the higher the diversity of inhabiting invertebrateand fish communities. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope isknown to occur, the occurrence of the biotope in the photic zone is restricted to the negative surfaces offor example boulders.
AA.A1H2, AB.A1H2, AA.M1H2 and AB.M1H2 have been placed in the Red List classification to the category of Near Threatened (NT) biotopes.

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.H1B7, AA.I1B7, AA.J1B7 and AA.M1B7 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.
Description
Baltic photic muddy sediment, coarse sediment, sand or mixed substrate dominated by common eelgrass (Zostera marina)

The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.

Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. 
This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.H1B7, AA.I1B7, AA.J1B7 andAA.M1B7according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:
The Zostera beds are common from Kattegat to the Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic, and thesalinity gradient from south to north causesconsiderable differences to the composition of theassociated fauna and flora.In the southern Baltic Sea the eelgrass usually forms pure stands along theouter, exposed coastline, whereas in the northern part of the Baltic Sea and insouthern bays andlagoons it often grows intermixed with other aquaticangiosperms. The largest occurrences of thebiotopes dominated by Zosteramarina are found in the southern Baltic Sea, where they represent oneof themost abundant biotopes of the sublittoral. The distribution map indicates thearea in the 100 x 100 kmgrid where biotope is known to occur based on field sampling data.
AA.H1B7, AA.I1B7, AA.J1B7 andAA.M1B7have been placed in the Red List classification to the category of Near Threatened (NT) biotopes.

    dcterms:description "This dataset depicts risk of oil spill from groundings. The modeled risk is calculated for the years 2008/2009. The area of the bubbles corresponds to the risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances. The unit of the risk is average tonnes per year. This dataset has been produced by Albrecht Lentz, COWI (http://www.cowi.dk) for the BRISK project (Sub-regional risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea, http://www.brisk.helcom.fi/). The dataset is a model result from a software code owned and operated by COWI. BRISK and BRISK-RU provide information on spatial distribution of risks of pollution from ships in the six sub-regions of the Baltic Sea, according to different types of accidents and spill sizes. The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic. Groundings and ship-to-ship collisions are by far the most likely types of accidents resulting in pollution. Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface. The effects of oil drift, weathering and fate, as well as the oil recovery are taken into account.

Description

Boreal Baltic narrow inletsThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1650 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Fjords are present in Swedish and Finnish coastal areas of the Bothnian Sea, the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Proper.

Estimated observations of the biotope AB.H4U1 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic aphotic muddy sediment dominated by meiofaunaThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AB.H4U1 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The biotope is assumed to occur throughout the Baltic Sea both in shallow coastal waters and in the deeper central parts of the sea. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is reported to occur. The biotope may have a significantly wider distribution.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

Species distribution modelling studies have shown the importance of suitable environmental conditions for pikeperch recruitment. Due to lack of coherent data on pikeperch spawning and nursery areas across the Baltic Sea countries, environmental variables were used in delineating potential recruitment areas for pikeperch.
The pikeperch recruitment area presented on the map is mainly delineated by selecting areas where depth < 5 m, logged exposure < 5, salinity < 7 PSU, Secchi depth < 2 m and distance to deep (10m) water < 4km. The threshold values have been obtained from literature (Veneranta et al. 2011, Bergström et al. 2013, Sundblad et al. 2013, Kallasvuo et al. 2016). Temperature, although important for pikeperch, was left out due to high variation in timing of suitable spawning temperatures across the Baltic Sea. In Finnish coastal waters, a national pikeperch model (Kallasvuo et al. 2016) has been used, with very suitable areas for pikeperch generalized to 1 km grid.

    dcterms:description """Eutrophication, caused by excess inputs of nutrients, is one of the main threats affecting the Baltic Sea marine environment. Nutrients enter the Baltic Sea as waterborne (riverine inputs from the catchment area and direct discharges from point and diffuse sources in coastal areas) and airborne (atmospheric deposition) inputs. In 2007 HELCOM adopted a nutrient reduction scheme which is based on maximum allowable nutrient inputs (MAI) to reach "good environmental status" and country-wise nutrient reduction targets (CART) to share the burden of reducing nutrient pollution to the sea (HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan). Monitoring of nutrient inputs to the sea is important for assessing progress of countries towards their CART and to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to reduce pollution.

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.H1A2 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic muddy sediment dominated by sedges (Cyperaceae)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.H1A2 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The muddy sedge biotope can be found in very sheltered lagoons and in some estuaries around the whole Baltic Sea however the main distribution of the biotope along the coast of the Baltic Sea is in the northern parts. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is estimated to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

The meteorological seasons are used for subdivision and the hydrological year begins in autumn and ends in summer. The snow cover duration is made available for three time periods: the snow cover duration for the entire hydrological year (SCD), the early snow cover duration (SCDE), which extends from autumn to midwinter (), and the late snow cover duration (SCDL), which in turn extends over the period from mid-winter to the end of summer. For the northern hemisphere SCD lasts from September 1st to August 31st, for the southern hemisphere it lasts from March 1st to February 28th/29th. The SCDE lasts from September 1st to January 14th in the northern hemisphere and from March 1st to July 14th in the southern hemisphere. The SCDL lasts from January 15th to August 31st in the northern hemisphere and from July 15th to February 28th/29th in the southern hemisphere.
          The “Global SnowPack” is derived from daily, operational MODIS snow cover product for each day since February 2000. Data gaps due to polar night and cloud cover are filled in several processing steps, which provides a unique global data set characterized by its high accuracy, spatial resolution of 500 meters and continuous future expansion. It consists of the two main elements daily snow cover extent (SCE) and seasonal snow cover duration (SCD; full and for early and late season). Both parameters have been designated by the WMO as essential climate variables, the accurate determination of which is important in order to be able to record the effects of climate change. Changes in the largest part of the cryosphere in terms of area have drastic effects on people and the environment.

Following the voluntary commitment from HELCOM Contracting Parties at the United Nations Oceans Conference in June 2017, HELCOM started the process of identifying EBSAs in the Baltic Sea. The February 2018 EBSA workshop resulted in a proposal for areas for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to consider during the later half of 2018.

Nine Baltic marine areas were described by the workshop participants as ecologically or biologically significant, including five transboundary areas covering waters of two or more countries. The described EBSAs extend into 14 of the 17 Baltic Sea sub-basins. Altogether, they cover 23% of the Baltic Sea, slightly higher than the 19% the average in other areas of the world.

The described EBSAs are:
- Northern Bothnian Bay
- Kvarken Archipelago
- Åland Sea, Åland Islands and the Archipelago Sea of Finland
- Eastern Gulf of Finland
- Inner Sea of West Estonian Archipelago
- Southeastern Baltic Sea Shallows
- Southern Gotland Harbour Porpoise Area

See the scan_data.xlsx for individual details of each laser scan location, and readme.txt for a complete description. In each scan site folder you can find the unprocessed raw files and processed ascii files. Note, not all processed files are georeferenced.This is due to time constraints on field data collection. Georeferencing for these data can be achieved by point cloud matching to other georeferenced scans. Photos for structure from motion (SfM) datasets were collected with a Nikon camera.

    dcterms:description "The 5km Hex GS Shrink Swell dataset shows a generalised view of the GeoSure Shrink Swell v8 dataset to a hexagonal grid resolution of 64.95km coverage area (side length of 5km). This dataset indicates areas of potential ground movement in a helpful and user-friendly format. The rating is based on a highest level of susceptibility identified within that Hex area: Low (1), Moderate (2), Significant (3). Areas of localised significant rating are also indicated. The summarising process via spatial statistics at this scale may lead to under or over estimation of the extent of a hazard. The supporting GeoSure reports can help inform planning decisions and indicate causes of subsidence. The Shrink Swell methodology is based on the BGS Digital Map (DiGMapGB-50) and expert knowledge of the behaviour of the formations so defined. This dataset provides an assessment of the potential for a geological deposit to shrink and swell. Many soils contain clay minerals that absorb water when wet (making them swell), and lose water as they dry (making them shrink). This shrink-swell behaviour is controlled by the type and amount of clay in the soil, and by seasonal changes in the soil moisture content (related to rainfall and local drainage). The rock formations most susceptible to shrink-swell behaviour are found mainly in the south-east of Britain. Clay rocks elsewhere in the country are older and have been hardened by burial deep in the earth and are less able to absorb water. The BGS has carried out detailed geotechnical and mineralogical investigations into rock types known to shrink, and are modelling their properties across the near surface. This research underpins guidance contained in the national GeoSure dataset, and is the basis for our responses to local authorities, companies and members of the public who require specific information on the hazard in their areas. The BGS is undertaking a wide-ranging research programme to investigate this phenomenon by identifying those areas most at risk and developing sustainable management solutions.

In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use.

ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.J3L3 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic sand dominated by ocean quahog (Arctica islandica)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotop e and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.J3L3 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The main distribution area of this biotope is the western Baltic Sea. The largest populations of A. islandica are found in Kiel and Mecklenburg Bights (Zettler et al. 2001). The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential spawning areas for European flounder was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

European flounder (Platichthys flesus) is a key species in many coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, mainly in the central and southern sub-basins. Adults feed in shallow, coastal areas during summer and move out to deeper areas in winter, where the spawning takes place in spring. European flounder spawns above the sea floor in deep water, in areas with sufficiently high salinity for fertilization and pelagic egg development. ‘Potential spawning areas’ were initially delineated by a species distribution model (Orio et al. 2017) developed based on years 1993-1997 to consider a period with relatively better oxygen conditions, but applied with more recent data (2011-2014). The area was further delineated to encompass only areas deeper than 30 m in order to represent pelagic spawning habitat. ‘High probability spawning areas’ were identified as the sub-section encompassing salinity > 10. It should be noted that flounders in the Baltic Sea were recently separated into two species, and that spawning areas of the Baltic flounder (Platichthys solemdali) are described separately. The two data layers do not overlap and can be combined to obtain a map on spawning areas for both flounder species taken together. 

Stock: ICES identifies two stocks of European flounder in the Baltic Sea: ICES subdivisions 22-23 (Belt Sea and the Sound), and 24-25 (West of Bornholm and Southern Central Baltic Sea).

EFH type: Spawning areas

Approach: Species distribution modelling combined with identification of environmental salinity window and depth conditions for spawning.

Variables and thresholds: Depth > 30 m, Salinity > 10

Quality: The data layer is based on species distribution modelling focusing on mature flounder at the spawning stage and should be considered a rough estimation. 
The data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling. Other variables than those tested in the model may also be influential.
The studies from which the thresholds values for environmental variables have been obtained are based on publications conducted before the separation of Baltic flounder from European flounder but have taken the specific characteristics of the separate spawning ecotypes into account.
Note: the map on European flounder spawning areas is currently missing information for the western Baltic Sea including the Kattegat.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no spawning (0), potential spawning area (0.5) and high probability spawning area (1).

This dataset is for Grey seal. Good status is achieved for each species when the abundance of seals in each management unit is at least 10,000 individuals and the species-specific growth rate is achieved. Harbour seals in the southwestern Baltic and the Kattegat form a metapopulation, where subpopulations are genetically connected. The combined sizes of the subpopulations are here used to evaluate the Limit Reference level (LRL).

The status evaluation is presented separately for the three seal species. The grey seal in the Baltic proper is evaluated as a single unit, whereas the Kattegat grey seals are evaluated separately. The status of ringed seals is evaluated for two management units. The status of harbour seals is evaluated for three management units.

Under the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, 1971), each Contracting Party undertakes to designate at least one wetland site for inclusion in the List of Wetlands of International Importance (the “Ramsar List”). There are over 2,000 “Ramsar Sites” on the territories of over 160 Ramsar Contracting Parties across the world.

For more information on the Convention, please visit the Ramsar website http://www.ramsar.org.

The Ramsar Sites Information Service (RSIS) provides online information on wetlands that have been designated as internationally important.

All Site information is provided by the Contracting Parties to the Convention and is managed by the Ramsar Secretariat. Responsibility for the accuracy of the data lies with the Administrative Authority of the Party in which the Ramsar Site is located.

The Ramsar Secretariat provides open access to the RSIS and its data, to promote the conservation and wise use of wetlands. If you are interested in an overview of the Ramsar Sites network, or are looking for information on a specific Site, please visit the Explore Sites page.

You will find:

    a searchable database of Ramsar Sites, which holds information on the wetland types, ecology, land uses, threats, hydrological values of each Site as well as spatial information
    downloadable copies of Ramsar Information Sheets (RISs) for each site which have been provided by the Contracting Parties , including maps and supplementary information, Site summaries, and exportable data sets; and
    digital (GIS) boundaries of Sites, where available.

For any further questions, comments or other inquiries about the RSIS, please contact the Ramsar Secretariat at ramsar@ramsar.org.

Estimated observations of the biotope AA.G were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic peat bottomThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.Gaccording to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The peat bottom biotope is distributed mainly in the Western and Southern Baltic Sea in the Bay of Mecklenburg and to a lesser extent also in the Kiel Bay. The spatial restriction is due to natural history of the subfossile substrates. Distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

Thymallus thymallus has been placed to the Red List category of Critically Endangered (CR) species.

The map shows the sub-basins in the HELCOM area where the species is known to occur regularly and to reproduce (HELCOM 2012a)."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The Baltic Sea Impact Index is an assessment component that describes the potential cumulative burden on the environment in different parts of the Baltic Sea. The BSII is based on georeferenced datasets of human activities (36 datasets), pressures (18 datasets) and ecosystem components (36 datasets), and on sensitivity estimates of ecosystem components (so-called sensitivity scores) that combine the pressure and ecosystem component layers, created in http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/holas-ii  project. 

Cumulative impacts are calculated for each assessment unit (1 km2 grid cells) by summing all pressures occurring in the unit for each ecosystem component. Highest impacts are found from the cells where both are abundant, but high impacts can be caused also by a single pressure if there are diverse and sensitive habitats in the grid cell. All data sets and methodologies used in the index calculations are approved by all HELCOM Contracting Parties in review and acceptance processes. This data set covers the time period 2011-2016.

HELCOM requires spatially explicit information on fishing activity affecting the Baltic Sea marine ecosystem for policy purposes. In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia were not received. ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

    dcterms:description "BGS GeoScour provides river scour susceptibility information for Great Britain using a three-tiered data provision allowing increasing levels of understanding at different resolutions from catchment to local (channel/reach) scales. GeoScour includes 11 GIS layers, providing information on the natural characteristics and properties of catchment and riverine environments for the assessment of river scour in Great Britain. The data product fills a gap in current scour modelling, with the input of geological properties. It provides an improved toolkit to more easily assess and raise the profile of scour risk, now and in the future, to help infrastructure providers and funders prioritise resources, identify remedial works to preclude costly and prevent disruptive failures. The data product has broad applications through its adaptation to suit multiple types of asset likely to be affected by fluvial erosion. The GeoScour Data Product is designed to be used by multiple stakeholders with differing needs and therefore, can be interrogated at a number of levels. Tier 1 data provides a summary overview of the catchment characteristics, typical response type, and evolution. It can be used as a high-level overview for incorporation into catchment management plans, national reviews and catchment comparisons. Tier 2 data are available as smaller catchment areas and focusses on providing data for more detailed catchment management, natural flood management and similar uses. It analyses geological properties such as flood accommodation space, catchment run-off potential, and geomorphology types, as well as additional summary statistics of key environmental parameters such as protected sites and urban coverage. Tier 3 data provide the detailed riverine information that is designed to be incorporated into more complex river scour models. It provides the baseline geological context for river scour development and processes and identifies important factors that should be considered in any scour model. Factors such as material mineralogy, strength and density are key properties that can influence a river’s ability to scour. In addition, an assessment of river fall, sinuosity and flood accommodation space is also provided. This data is of use to all users assessing the propensity for river scour for any given reach of a river across Great Britain. Tier 1 and 2 data are available with an OGL, Tier 3 data is licenced."@en ;

Estimated observations of the biotopes AA.E1F1 and AB.E1F1 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic or aphotic shell gravel dominated by vase tunicate (Ciona intestinalis)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.E1F1 and AB.E1F1 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The biotopes are known from German waters in the Baltic Sea, but may also occur in other areas in the southwestern Baltic Sea where the vase tunicate (Ciona intestinalis) occurs. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotopes are known to occur. The biotopes may potentially occur in other areas with high salinity on shell gravel covered bottoms, but are currently not known from other locations.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

The BSII is based on georeferenced datasets of human activities (36 datasets), pressures (18 datasets) and ecosystem components (36 datasets), and on sensitivity estimates of ecosystem components (so-called sensitivity scores) that combine the pressure and ecosystem component layers, created in http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/holas-ii project. 

The assessment can be applied with a focus on pressures only by using the Baltic Sea Pressure Index (BSPI) which shows the anthropogenic pressures/human activities in the defined assessment units without including ecosystem components. The BSPI however includes a weighting component in order to grade the effect of the pressures on the ecosystem in a generalized perspective. Cumulative impacts are calculated for each assessment unit (1 km2 grid cells) by summing all impacts occurring in the unit. All datasets and methodologies used in the index calculations are approved by all HELCOM Contracting Parties in review and acceptance processes. This dataset covers the time period 2011-2016.

Estimated observations of the biotopes AA.D and AB.D were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Baltic photic and aphotic maërl beds (unattached particles of coralline red algae)The HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of AA.Dand AB.Daccording to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Known areas where maërl beds occur are on offshore banks in the Kattegat (e.g. Lilla Middelgrund and Fladen). The presence of dead maërl at some offshore banks indicates that the habitat must have been more widespread in the past. It is unclear how large a proportion of the maërl beds occur in the aphotic zone. Maërl beds have a patchy distribution. The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where maërl beds are known to occur.(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This dataset is the first dedicated SMOS Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) product for the Baltic basin to enhance the science capabilities in the Baltic region and help to fill the gaps and grand challenges identified by the scientific community. These new product has been created under the funded ESA project ITT Baltic+ Salinity dynamics (4000126102/18/I-BG).
This basin is one of the most challenging regions for the satellite SSS retrieval. The available EO-based SSS products are quite limited in terms of spatio-temporal coverage and quality. This is mainly due to technical limitations that strongly affect the brightness temperatures (TB), such as the high contamination by interferences and the contamination close to land and ice edges. Moreover, the sensitivity of TB to SSS changes is very low and dielectric models present limitations in this low salinity regime. 
Baltic+ L4 SSS product comprises 9 years (2011-2019) of daily maps at 0.05 degrees. A detailed explanation of the product algorithms and validation can be found at http://bec.icm.csic.es/doc/BEC_PD_SSS_Baltic_L3_L4.pdf and in the publication: Gonzalez-Gambau et al., “First SMOS Sea Surface Salinity dedicated products over the Baltic Sea“, Earth System Science Data, 2021 
We present here the seasonal averaged Baltic+ L4 SSS products for the period 2011-2019.

HELCOM requires spatially explicit information on fishing activity affecting the Baltic Sea marine ecosystem for policy purposes. In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia were not received. ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

HELCOM secretariat did the following processing to the data:

-	Conversion to ETRS89LAEA coordinate system

-	Added feature and attribute "Reported" to display unreported areas.

    dcterms:description "This layer of the map based index (GeoIndex) shows the locations of the Mineral Reconnaissance Programme Reports within Great Britain. The Mineral Reconnaissance Programme (MRP), funded by the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), carried out mineral exploration reconnaissance in Great Britain between 1972 and 1997. The programme provided geological, geochemical, geophysical, mineralogical and metallogenic information on prospective areas in Britain. Work was carried out at various scales, from regional reconnaissance surveys or appraisal, to the drilling of a geochemical or geophysical anomaly. Projects were multidisciplinary, and used a combination of tried and tested methods, together with innovative techniques arising from research and development programmes. By the end of the Programme in 1997, 146 MRP reports had been issued covering localities across the UK. The programme was very successful in that more than half the projects reported attracted significant commercial follow-up resulting in the discovery of many new prospects. The reports themselves are being made available, for free, to downlaod over the next twelve months."@en ;

Colour levels are defined by histogram equalisation. Combining this image with the grey shaded relief image produces a similar image to the colour shaded relief image. The measured gravity values have been corrected in order to show the anomalies attributable to variations in crustal density. In broad terms the blues are attributable to large volumes of low density rocks, the reds to high density rocks. Significant lows occur, for instance, over areas of thick, low density sedimentary rocks(e.g. Cheshire Basin, Wessex Basin), or large granites (eg Cornwall). For marine data, free-air anomalies have been calculated from observed gravity values along marine survey lines. Line intersection errors between crossing lines and overlapping surveys have been used using network adjustment techniques. Free air anomalies have been calculated for sea-bottom stations. For land data, bouguer anomalies have been calculated from gravity observations at points of known height. In order to minimise the effect of topography, Bouguer corrections for the British Mainland have been applied using a density estimated for each station. Elsewhere a correction density of 2.67 Mg/m3 has been used. Corrections for the gravitational effect of terrain have been made where significant, and in a general extent to a radius of 48.6km.

The principal collections are the E (England and Wales), S (Scotland), N (continuation of the S collection) and the MR (miscellaneous). The collections, which are held at the BGS offices at Keyworth (Nottingham) and Edinburgh, comprise both hand specimens and thin sections, although in individual samples either may not be immediately available. Users may also note that the BGS holds major collections of borehole cores and hand specimens as well as over a million palaeontological samples. The Britrocks database provides an index to these collections. With over 120,000 records, it now holds data for some 70% of the entire collections, including the UK samples shown in this application as well as rocks from overseas locations and reference minerals. The collections are continuously being added to and sample records from archived registers are also being copied into the electronic database.

HELCOM requires spatially explicit information on fishing activity affecting the Baltic Sea marine ecosystem for policy purposes. In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use. In 2015 ICES collated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data received; data from Russia were not received. ICES provided to HELCOM advice as fishing abrasion pressure maps as well as fishing effort maps.

HELCOM secretariat did the following processing to the data:

-	Conversion to ETRS89LAEA coordinate system

-	Added feature and attribute "Reported" to display unreported areas. 

Dataset attribute information:

c-square: Unique reference of the c-square polygon

mid_lat: latitude coordinate of the centroid of c-square inWGS84 decimal degrees

The UPGro Hidden Crisis project (2015-20) was an international research project aimed at developing a robust evidence base and understanding of the complex and multi-faceted causes which underlie the current high failure rates of many new groundwater supplies in Africa. The project was jointly funded by: DFID, NERC and ESRC as part of the UPGro programme. The project carried out the research work in three countries - Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda – to examine functionality and performance of groundwater supplies in a range of hydrogeological, climatic and social, institutional and governance environments in East Africa. The work focused specifically on examining the functionality of HPBs – these being the main form of improved community water supply across rural Africa.

    dcterms:description "This dataset provides a detailed physical science dataset to the groundwater resource and engineering properties of 150 handpumped borehole supplies (HPBs) across Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, surveyed in 2017. The dataset includes measurements of aquifer resource potential, groundwater quality, downhole construction and condition of handpump components, and borehole construction. Detailed social science data were also collected as part of the second survey phases of the Hidden Crisis project. However, these data are reported as a separate (associated) dataset to the physical science Survey 2 dataset – and are available from Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) UK Data Service (UKDS). The Hidden Crisis project (2015-20) was an international research project aimed at developing a robust evidence base and understanding of the complex and multi-faceted causes which underlie the current high failure rates of many new groundwater supplies in Africa. The project was jointly funded by: DFID, NERC and ESRC as part of the UPGro programme. The project carried out the research work in three countries - Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda – to examine functionality and performance of groundwater supplies in a range of hydrogeological, climatic and social, institutional and governance environments in East Africa. The work focused specifically on examining the functionality of HPBs – these being the main form of improved community water supply across rural Africa. The Survey 2 dataset, is major dataset developed by the project."@en ;

Estimated observations of the biotope 1620 were collected from the Baltic Sea area by expert judgements for HELCOM Red List of biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes.

Description

Boreal Baltic islets and small islandsThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1620 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:The distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur (Naturvårdverket 2011).(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The SkySat constellation is comprised of 21 micro satellites with a size of 60 x 60 x 80 cm. SkySats can be tasked to acquire panchromatic and multispectral images of the Earth in high resolution (up to 50 centimeter) and at sub-daily frequency. They can also capture stereo imagery and video footage for up to 90 seconds. The first SkySat was launched in 2013, whereas higher resolution SkySat-C generation satellites were first launched in 2016. The SkySat constellation is owned and operated by Planet.
The SkySat imagery of this collection covers specific test sites. The data has been purchased by the German Space Agency with funds from the Ministry of Economy and is available for Germany-based researchers for scientific use. The data collection is maintained by the German Satellite Data Archive (D-SDA) of DLR’s Earth Observation Center and can be accessed via the EOWEB Geoportal. 
This collection comprises SkySat Collect products. The Ortho Collect product is created by composing SkySat Ortho Scenes along an imaging strip into segments typically unifying approximately 60 SkySat Ortho Scenes. It includes multispectral (BGRN) as well as the panchromatic (PAN) assets. Radiometric corrections to correct for any sensor artifacts and transformation to top-of-atmosphere radiance are applied. If available, the atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectance layer is included.

    dcterms:description """SeaCause cruise SO186-2, aboard the RV Sonne, was carried out off northern Sumatra between 21st January and 24th February 2006, with mobilisation and demobilisation in Singapore and Penang, Malaysia, respectively. The geophysical survey acquired multichannel seismic data (MCS) using a 240 channel, 3 km Sercel streamer, and a tuned airgun array comprising 16 airguns with a total capacity of 50.8 litres. Bathymetry data, using the 12 kHz Simrad swath system, subseabed data using the hull mounted high resolution Parasound profiler together with gravity and magnetic data were also acquired. 
The main scientific objective of the survey was to investigate the southern part of the rupture zone of the 26th December 2004 9.3 magnitude earthquake, that caused the catastrophic tsunami of that date, and the rupture zone of the 8.7 magnitude earthquake of March 28th 2005. Specifically, to identify the segment boundary between the two earthquakes, as recognised by the distribution of their aftershocks. This was to be achieved by mapping the structure of the subduction zone including the dip angle of the subducted plate, the architecture of the accretionary prism and the structure of the forearc basins, particularly their strike-slip fault systems. Also to be investigated was whether there was a contribution to the 2004 tsunami from major submarine failures. 
During the survey a total of 5358 line kilometres of MCS data were acquired, mainly on lines oriented orthogonal to the subduction zone and extending from the ocean basin across the trench and accretionary prism to the forearc basins offshore Sumatra. The orthogonal survey lines were located on average approximately 40 km apart. The survey was planned using the bathymetry from the HMS Scott, RV Natsushima and RV Sonne cruises carried out in 2004. 
The morphology of the trench and sediment thickness varies from north to south. In the north the trench is poorly defined with shallow seabed dip but with sediment thickness of ~3.5 secs (TWT). The seafloor dips increase southwards, but sediment thickness decreases to ~2.5 secs (TWT) off Nias. Both the ocean basin and trench sediments are dissected by numerous normal faults, oriented subparallel to the plate boundary, with many that penetrate the oceanic crust. In the south Fracture Zones were identified. 
The structure of the deformation front on the seaward margin of the accretionary prism is highly variable. While the younges main thrust are predominantly landward vergent there are examples for seaward verging thrusts. The frontal fold develops in some cases already in the french while in most cases the frontal fold is at the beginning of the accretionary wedge. At some locations there are large sediment slumps on the frontal thrusts, the slope angle of the prism varies between 6 to 15 degrees, an angle that explains the large scale slumping.
The width of the accretionary prism is widest in the north of the area at 140 km and narrows southwards until in the vicinity of the islands it is 40 km. 
In the north and central parts of the survey area the passage from the deformation front landwards into the older prism is rapid and the seabed gradients steep. The dip of the oceanic crust remains low and there is an obvious twofold increase (6-7 seconds TWT) in the sediment thickness. The basal decollement of the thrusts at the deformation front is in the lower sediment layer overlying oceanic basement. This is traced northeastward. A possible explanation for the increase in thickness of the prism is therefore considered to be the formation of a thrust duplex. Perhaps this is due to the subducted sediment thickness. In this region the prism forms a plateau and the internal pattern of the uppermost sediments shows striking similarities to the trench fill. Offshore of Simeulue Island the prism structure changes and it forms the more usually seen taper. The offscraped sediment forms a thinner section, the thrusts are more steeply dipping. The dip of the subducted plate here is greater than in the north. 
Three forearc basins were surveyed. In the north the western margin of the Aceh Basin lies along the West Andaman Fault. Within the main basin the sediments are internally undeformed. Farther south in the Simeulue Basin the northern and central parts there are numerous, active steeply dipping faults. In southern part of the basin there is a transpressional fault similarly to the Mentawi Fault off southern Sumatra. There are notable ‘bright spots’ in the upper section that may indicate the presence of hydrocarbon gas. There are also widespread Bottom Simulating Reflectors indication the presence of gashydrates and there may be also one double BSR. At the southern end of the surveyed area the Nias Basin may be subdivided along its length into two parts by a northnorthwest to southsoutheast trending carbonate platform development. The basin has had a varying subsidence history, in the south the subsidence was completed before the northern part started."""@en ;

Each GPR profile has a Sensors and Software GPR (.DT1) file, and associated header (.HD) and GPS (.GPS) files. The .HD files (which can be opened as text files) give the parameters and equipment used for each profile. GPS files are not available for some of the profiles collected on Falljökull in April 2013 (due to damage that occurred to the GPS linked with the PulseEKKO Pro system). For these profiles start, finish, and mid profile positions were recorded using differential GPS, and locations of these profiles are instead given by GIS shapefiles in the relevant folders. These datasets have been used in the publications listed below. Further information relating to the data collection methodology can be found therein.

    dcterms:description "This dataset depicts risk of oil spills from collision with fixed objects and spills from offshore platforms, terminals, bunkering and STS operation. The modeled risk is calculated for the scenario year 2020 based on predicted traffic density. The area of the bubbles corresponds to the risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances. The unit of the risk is average tonnes per year. This dataset has been produced by Albrecht Lentz, COWI (http://www.cowi.dk) for the BRISK project (Sub-regional risk of spill of oil and hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea, http://www.brisk.helcom.fi/). The dataset is a model result from a software code owned and operated by COWI. BRISK and BRISK-RU provide information on spatial distribution of risks of pollution from ships in the six sub-regions of the Baltic Sea, according to different types of accidents and spill sizes. The assessment takes into account the existing risk control measures as well as the prognosis for future maritime traffic. Groundings and ship-to-ship collisions are by far the most likely types of accidents resulting in pollution. Other kinds of incidents, such as fire, collisions with fixed objects, spills from offshore platforms, as well as illegal discharges have minor contribution to the risks. Further, the oil impact has been modelled. The oil impact can be described as the amount of spilled oil that is expected on the sea surface. The effects of oil drift, weathering and fate, as well as the oil recovery are taken into account.

    dcterms:description "The map of the \"Soil Regions of the European Union and Adjacent Countries 1:5,000,000 (Version 2.0)\" is published by the Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), in partnership with the Joint Research Center (JRC, Ispra). The soil regions map is intended to support the current national mapping activities towards a European 1:250,000 datbase by stratifying similar regional soil associations into a hierarchical concept. Only by stratification, the complexity of soils can be systematically structured so that the complex 1:250,000 legend can be handled in cross-national and contintental-level applications. Soil regions are natural, cross-regional soil geographical units which perform the highest spatial and content-based aggregation of European soils. They represent the frame conditions for soil development at the landscape level. The soil regions are presented at scale 1:5,000,000. Thus, its borders are highly generalized. Because of its low resolution, the map units absorb atypical soils and associations of soils, which are only described in higher resolution soil maps. The delineation of the soil regions is expected to be refined (and probably improved by its content) during the actual 1:250,000 mapping process. Thus, updating can be expected in the future. Currently, the soil regions map is the only graphical soil representation in Europe which has been developed using fully comparable and harmonized basic data at the continental level (climate, hydrography, relief, geology, vegetation): the interpretation of this input data, and the utilization of expert knowledge (including the interpretation of regional soil maps) has been done using one common methodology, developed and applied consistently throughout the whole mapping area by an experienced international soil mapper (Dr. Reinhard Hartwich, former member of BGR, and co-author of the 1998 Manual of Procedures). The methodology is extensively described in the Explanatory Notes (German), and in the revised Manual of Procedures which is expected to be completed soon. It is highly recommended to apply and interpret the map using the map comments and descriptions as provided in the explanatory notes (German: Hartwich et al. 2005; English: revision of the Manual of Procedures, initial version: Finke et al. 2001)."@en ;

Main target of the PANORAMA-2 cruise was the acquisition of new geophysical data and the probing of surficial sediments in the underexplored area of the Sørkapp Basin and Olga Basin. In the course of the 20 day lasting Leg1 of the PANORAMA-2 cruise geophysical data acquisition was carried out. About 1750 km of 2D multi-channel seismic data were acquired and about 350 km of wide angle seismic data by means of sonobuoys. Sediment echosounder data, multi-beam data, gravity data and geomagnetic data were acquired during the entire cruise in a 24/7 mode within the survey area. After a 1-day stopover in Longyearbyen for a crew change of a part of the scientific crew, the research vessel OGS Explora returned to the survey area for another 11 days. During Leg-2 of the PANORAMA-2 cruise the surficial sediments were sampled by means of gravity corer, multi corer and dredge at 34 stations all together. Sediment sampling was carried out during day-light times only. Night times were used for acquisition of geomagnetic data, gravity data, sediment echosounder data and multi-beam data."@en ;

Description

Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the timeThe HELCOM Red List of Baltic Sea underwater biotopes, habitats and biotope complexes (2013) is an updated and improved version of the Red List assessment of marine and coastal biotopes and biotope complexes published in 1998. The classification of the report follows the proposed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria and assessment principals but with some modifications for the Baltic Sea.Altogether, the HELCOM Underwater Biotope and habitat classification (HELCOM HUB) includes 209 biotopes of which 59 were red-listed. Many of the red-listed biotopes are located in deep areas of the Baltic Sea due to oxygen-free nature as well as in the southwestern Baltic Sea due to the salinity restricted distribution of species in certain biotope. The HELCOM assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and inference, and the questionnaire data represents the estimated presence-absence data not in-situ measured data. This must be taken in account when observing the map presentation. The biotopes are shown on the map using the EEA 100 km grid. This dataset displays estimated presence of the biotope 1110 according to HELCOM RED LIST assessment experts:Sandbanks are widely spread throughout the whole Baltic Sea area, and occur in all HELCOM sub-regions. The Distribution map indicates the area in the 100 x 100 km grid where biotope is known to occur (Naturvårdverket 2011, EUNIS Database).(Data (expert judgements) collected in HELCOM RED LIST project, released in May 2013)"""@en ;

In order to obtain this information a joint ICES/HELCOM/OSPAR data call was issued to relevant authorities of contracting parties to deliver information on fishing activity based on VMS/Log book data. The raw data was submitted to ICES and processed to advice data products by ICES Working Group for Spatial Fisheries (WGSFD) as requested by HELCOM. Processing of the raw data requires specific resources, knowledge and guarantee of anonymity for specific vessels, thus the process was done by ICES WGSFD following Conditions for VMS data use.

    dcterms:description """As recommended by the Joint CCOP-IOC Working Group on Post-IDOE Studies on East Asia Tectonics and Resources and the proposal of the Bureau of Mines and Geosciences of the Philippines to extend the research of the previous R/V SONNE survey SO-23, the Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) carried out a geophysical survey in the southeastern part of the South China Sea (Dangerous Grounds) and in the northwestern part of the Sulu Sea in two legs from 29th April to 29th June 1983 on SONNE cruise SO-27.
Multichannel reflection seismic measurements were carried out in parallel with magnetic, gravimetric, Sea-Beam, and 3.5 kHz subbottom profiler measurements on 34 lines with a total length of 7,204 km. In addition, 26 lines with a total length of 2,800 km were surveyed with only the last four named methods. SONNE cruise SO-27 was financed by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT).
Six seismic sequences (DG-1 to DG-6) (DG = Dangerous Grounds) could be distinguished in the surveyed part of the South China Sea. The oldest recognizable sequence is the sequence DG-6, an equivalent of the Pre-Nido Formation of the northwest shelf of Palawan. Seismic unconformity Violet marks the top of the DG-6 sequence, which consists of a complex system of tilted horsts and half-grabens.
The half-grabens are presumably filled with clastic sediments of Eocene age (seismic sequence DG-5). The top of seismic sequence DG-5 is bounded by unconformity Blue, which is interpreted as representing the end of the rift phase and the onset of seafloor spreading in the South China Sea about 32 m.y. ago.
The overlying seismic sequence DG-4 is characterized by an internal reflection pattern with low frequencies. Lithologically, this sequence consists of shallow-water carbonates with reef complexes of Oligocene to Early Miocene age and has to be regarded as equivalent to the oil-containing Nido Formation of the Palawan shelf. A rapid subsidence of large parts of the survey area during the late (?) Early Miocene ended the growth of the shallow water carbonate platform, indicated by the unconformity Blue.
The overlying seismic sequence DG-3 is interpreted as consisting of a transitional facies between a shallow water and a bathyal depositional environment. The top of this sequence is marked by unconformity Red, which most probably represents the end of the drifting phase (seafloor spreading) in the South China Sea during the Middle Miocene.
The most prominent structural feature of the shelf and slope of central and southern Palawan is a thick sedimentary wedge originally interpreted as a melange. Our data show that the Oligocene to Early Miocene carbonate platform of the Dangerous Grounds extends beneath the Palawan Trough, as well as beneath the central and southern Palawan shelf, underlying the melange.
Based on the finding that i) Rhaeto-Liassic rocks are present in the Dangerous Grounds, ii) the Oligocene to Early Miocene carbonate platform continues from the Dangerous Grounds through the Palawan Trough to the central and southern Palawan shelf, and iii) there is thinned continental crust 20 km thick below the continental slope of southern Palawan, we believe the Dangerous Grounds, together with Palawan and the Caiman Islands belong to a uniform continental fragment which separated from the proto-chinese continental margin when the South China Sea opened during the Oligocene. Previously, the melange of central and southern Palawan, which contains ophiolites, was interpreted as being autochthonous. In our opinion, the melange is an allochthonous mass which has been overthrusted onto the eastern margin of the Dangerous Grounds-Palawan-Caiman microcontinent from the Northwest Sulu Basin. The Ulugan Bay fault is interpreted as the northeastern front of this allochthonous mass.
The area of prospective carbonate plays is considerably enlarged by the discovery that the Oligocene to Early Miocene carbonate platform with Nido-type reef structures extends below the allochthonous sediments of central and southern Palawan. We expect that hydrocarbon-bearing structures of the Sabah-type, i. e. thick, folded Neogene sediments, will be found in the western part of the northwestern Sulu basin. If our interpretation is correct, a new chapter of hydrocarbon exploration may be about to begin around Palawan in the Philippines."""@en ;

During data acquisition, spectrums were input into The Spectral Geologist (TSG) to provide an instant and estimated mineral identification using the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The samples were acquired during field visits between 2017 - 2019 by the British Geological Survey and the GW4+ Doctorial Training Partnership (NE/L002434/1). This data was primarily used to aid sample collection for further hydrothermal alteration analyses to improve our understanding of regional and local paleo-hydrothermal activity across the island. Identification by the TSG provides an estimation only, and the raw data files in .txt, .fos and .csv formats, are supplied for each analysis in the attached zipped file. This may be useful within the metallic and industrial mineral mining sector and associated researchers. The data includes grid references (± 5 m), TSG interpretations, and field/sample observations noted during data acquisition. GW4+ Doctoral Training Partnership (NE/L002434/1) is supported by grant award GA/09F/139 – RMS E3557, and the British Geological Survey’s University Funding Initiative (BUFI S345)."@en ;

Multiple samples of pumice and lava spanning the whole eruption sequence were collected from several locations in the area surrounding NE-Bay on Ascension Island. This dataset includes compositional, clast size, abundance, clast density and vesicle texture data for the products of the Echo Canyon eruption. Data was collected between the 12th June 2018 and the 30th August 2020 on Ascension Island and at the University of East Anglia, UK. Compositional data was collected using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), density of pumice clasts using the Archimedes suspension method and textural data by visual inspection of sample vesicle shape and size, all at the University of East Anglia, UK. Clast size and abundance was semi-quantitatively estimated in the field on Ascension Island and later checked against photographs. This data provides a framework through which changes to eruption style were reconstructed and is useful to any persons wishing to study or compare small-volume eruption deposits which record eruptive transitions. The data supports and forms the basis of Davies et al., (2021) (DOI : 10.1007/s00445-021-01480-1) and forms part of B V Davies’ Natural Environment Research Council funded PhD project investigating eruption controls on Ascension Island.

The data is made by spatial-temporal interpolation of five observed collections of multiple-sensor, multiple-platform satellite imageries. Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM sensor) supports the 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2014 epochs. Sentinel2 (S2) composite (GHS-composite-S2 R2020A) supports the 2018 epoch. The built-up surface fraction (BUFRAC) is estimated at 10m of spatial resolution from the S2 image data, using as learning set a composite of data from GHS-BUILT-S2 R2020A, Facebook, Microsoft, and Open Street Map (OSM) building delineation. The BUFRAC inference is made from the combination of quantized image features (reflectance, derivative of morphological profile DMP) through associative rule learning applied to spatial data analytics, which was introduced as symbolic machine learning (SML). The non-residential (NRES) domain is predicted from S2 image data by observation of radiometric, textural, and morphological features in an object-oriented image processing framework. The multi-temporal dimension is provided by testing by the SML the association between the combination of the quantized radiometric information collected by the Landsat imagery in the past epochs, and the “built-up” (BU) and “non-built-up” (NBU) class abstraction on image segments extracted from S2 images. The spatial-temporal interpolation is solved by rank-optimal spatial allocation using explanatory variables related to the landscape (slope, elevation, distance to water, and distance to vegetation) and related to the observed dynamic of BU surfaces in the past epochs."@en ;

The data comprises a series of occurrence maps shows the distribution of rock units that form the principal aquifers and some major shale and clay units in England and Wales. In addition, a series of separation maps show the vertical separation between pairs of shales or clays and overlying aquifers. If shale gas resources are to be developed in the UK, the implications for groundwater will need to be considered as part of any risk assessment. A step in such an assessment will be to understand and quantify the spatial relationships between the potential shale gas source rocks (including both shales and some clay units) and overlying aquifers. The datasets used to produce the aquifer maps, the shale and clay occurrence maps and the separation maps are available to download for your own use. As with other BGS data sets available for download, this will enable you to work offline to develop your own systems and methodologies using BGS data.

    dcterms:description """<p><strong>Numeracja adresowa</strong> to uporządkowany system przypisywania identyfikatorów miejscom otaczającej nas przestrzeni, których celem jest zapewnienie możliwości ich rozróżniania i identyfikowania. Z natury rzeczy numeracja adresowa dotyczy terenów zabudowanych (skupisk ludzkich), bo w innych przypadkach bazujemy na metodach identyfikacji opartych na obiektach referencyjnych takich jak działki ewidencyjne czy wprost na współrzędnych geograficznych <strong>(φ,λ)</strong>. W większości stosowanej w rożnych krajach numeracji adresowej identyfikator zbudowany jest z nazwy miejscowości, nazwy ulicy i kolejnego numeru przy ulicy.
Miejscem prezentacji danych adresowych wraz z możliwością ich wyszukiwania jest gminny portal mapowy, dostępny pod adresem http://pruszczgdanski.e-mapa.net. W portalu można znaleźć także wiele innych danych przestrzennych dotyczących naszej jednostki. Dodatkowo dla danych adresowych udostępniona jest usługa <strong>WMS</strong> (Web Map Service), dzięki której dane adresowe gminy można prezentować w dowolnych serwisach mapowych.</p>

<h4>Podstawa prawna</h4>

<p>W Polsce numeracja adresowa prowadzona jest na podstawie art. 47a i 47b ustawy z dnia 17 maja 1989r. <em>Prawo Geodezyjne i Kartograficzne</em> (Dz. U  z 2016r., poz.1629) oraz wydanego na jej podstawie <em>Rozporządzenia Ministra Administracji i Cyfryzacji z dnia 9 stycznia 2012 roku w sprawie ewidencji miejscowości, ulic i adresów</em> (Dz. U. z 2012 r. poz. 125).</p>
