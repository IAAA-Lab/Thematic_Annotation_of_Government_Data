    dcterms:description "This dataset comprises 2 collections of maps. The facsmile collection contains all the marginalia information from the original map as well as the map itself, while the georectified collection contains just the map with an associated index for locating them. Each collection comprises approximately 101 000 monochrome images at 6-inch (1:10560) scale. Each image is supplied in .tiff format with appropriate ArcView and MapInfo world files, and shows the topography for all areas of England, Wales and Scotland as either quarter or, in some cases, full sheets. The images will cover the approximate epochs 1880's, 1900's, 1910's, 1920's and 1930's, but note that coverage is not countrywide for each epoch. The data was purchased by BGS from Sitescope, who obtained it from three sources - Royal Geographical Society, Trinity College Dublin and the Ordnance Survey. The data is for internal use by BGS staff on projects, and is available via a customised application created for the network GDI enabling users to search for and load the maps of their choice. The dataset will have many uses across all the geoscientific disciplines across which BGS operates, and should be viewed as a valuable addition to the BGS archive. There has been a considerable amount of work done during 2005, 2006 and 2007 to improve the accuracy of the OS Historic Map Collection. All maps should now be located to +- 50m or better. This is the best that can be achieved cost effectively. There are a number of reasons why the maps are inaccurate. Firstly, the original maps are paper and many are over 100 years old. They have not been stored in perfect condition. The paper has become distorted to varying degrees over time. The maps were therefore not accurate before scanning. Secondly, different generations of maps will have used different surveying methods and different spatial referencing systems. The same geographical object will not necessarily be in the same spatial location on subsequent editions. Thirdly, we are discussing maps, not plans. There will be cartographic generalisations which will affect the spatial representation and location of geographic objects. Finally, the georectification was not done in BGS but by the company from whom we purchased the maps. The company no longer exists. We do not know the methodology used for georectification."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The original version of this dataset contained lithologies interpreted as representing a mineral resource for mineral extraction. Collated on a County by County basis as part of the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) Mineral Resource Information in support of National Regional and Local Planning between 1994 and 2006. A primary objective is to produce baseline data in a consistent format that can be updated, revised and customised to suit planning needs, including Mineral Local Plans and Regional Planning Guidance, as well as those of industry. The BGS Mineral Resource data does not determine mineral reserves and therefore does not denote potential areas of extraction. Only onshore, mainland mineral resources are included in the dataset. This dataset has been produced by the collation and interpretation of mineral resource data principally held by the British Geological Survey. The mineral resource data presented are based on the best available information, but are not comprehensive and their quality is variable. The dataset should only be used to show a broad distribution of those mineral resources which may be of current or potential economic interest. The data should not be used to determine individual planning applications or in taking decisions on the acquisition or use of a particular piece of land, although they may give useful background information which sets a specific proposal in context. During 2011-2012 revisions were made to areas of the resource linework. These changes were made as a result of new research and release of a new version of DiGMap (v5). This work was on an ad hoc basis but affects all resource layers. The paper maps were not re-released with this data update."@en ;

The reports can help inform planning decisions and indicate causes of subsidence. The methodology is based on BGS DiGMap (Digital Map) and expert knowledge of the behaviour of the formations so defined. This dataset provides an assessment of the potential for a geological deposit to shrink and swell. Many soils contain clay minerals that absorb water when wet (making them swell), and lose water as they dry (making them shrink). This shrink-swell behaviour is controlled by the type and amount of clay in the soil, and by seasonal changes in the soil moisture content (related to rainfall and local drainage). The rock formations most susceptible to shrink-swell behaviour are found mainly in the south-east of Britain. Clay rocks elsewhere in the country are older and have been hardened by burial deep in the earth and are less able to absorb water. The BGS has carried out detailed geotechnical and mineralogical investigations into rock types known to shrink, and are modelling their properties across the near surface. This research underpins guidance contained in the national GeoSure dataset, and is the basis for our responses to local authorities, companies and members of the public who require specific information on the hazard in their areas. The BGS is undertaking a wide-ranging research programme to investigate this phenomenon by identifying those areas most at risk and developing sustainable management solutions. Complete Great Britain national coverage is available. The storage formats of the data are ESRI and MapInfo but other formats can be supplied."@en ;

The methodology is based on BGS DiGMap (Digital Map) and expert knowledge of the behaviour of the formations so defined. This dataset provides an assessment of the potential for dissolution within a geological deposit. Ground dissolution occurs when certain types of rock contain layers of material that may dissolve if they get wet. This can cause underground cavities to develop. These cavities reduce support to the ground above and can lead to a collapse of overlying rocks. Dissolution of soluble rocks produces landforms and features collectively known as 'karst'. Britain has four main types of soluble or 'karstic' rocks; limestone, chalk, gypsum and salt, each with a different character and associated potential hazards. Engineering problems associated with these karstic rocks include subsidence, sinkhole formation, uneven rock-head and reduced rock-mass strength.

    dcterms:description "Data identifying landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with geological names. The scale of the data is 1:25 000 scale. Onshore coverage is partial and BGS has no intention to create a national coverage at this scale. Areas covered are essentially special areas of 'classic' geology and include Llandovery (central Wales), Coniston (Lake District) and Cuillan Hills (Isle of Skye). Data are supplied as five themes: bedrock, superficial deposits, mass movement, artificial ground and linear features. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. The bedrock theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with geological names. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. Mass movement describes areas where deposits have moved down slope under gravity to form landslips. These landslips can affect bedrock, superficial or artificial ground. Mass movement deposits are described in the BGS Rock Classification Scheme Volume 4. However the data also includes foundered strata, where ground has collapsed due to subsidence (this is not described in the Rock Classification Scheme). Caution should be exercised with this data; whilst mass movement events are recorded in this layer, due to the dynamic nature of occurrence significant changes may have occurred since the data was released, as such it should be viewed as a snapshot in time (data should be regarded as at 2008). Artificial (man-made) theme (shown as polygons) indicates areas where the ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. Whilst artificial ground may not be considered as part of the 'real geology' of bedrock and superficial deposits it does affect them. Artificial ground impacts on the near surface ground conditions which are important to human activities and economic development. Due to the constantly changing nature of land use and re-use/redevelopment, caution must be exercised when using this data as it represents a snapshot in time rather than an evolving picture hence the data may become dated very rapidly. Linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. However landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits. All five data themes are available in vector format (containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes) as ESRI shapefiles and are available under BGS data licence. Another batch of tiles was added to the data in 2012 to bring the total to 167 for this version 2 release."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The groundwater flooding susceptibility data shows the degree to which areas of England, Scotland and Wales are susceptible to groundwater flooding on the basis of geological and hydrogeological conditions. It does not show the likelihood of groundwater flooding occurring, i.e. it is a hazard not risk-based dataset. The data covers Great Britain in a consistent manner. It will be updated periodically (at least bi-annually) as the underlying datasets or the methodology to derive the groundwater flooding susceptibility data are improved. The data is based on data sets with a range of resolutions, but the derived data set has an effective spatial resolution of about 50m by 50m. The susceptibility data is suitable for use for regional or national planning purposes where the groundwater flooding information will be used along with a range of other relevant information to inform land-use planning decisions. It might also be used in conjunction with a large number of other factors, e.g. records of previous incidence of groundwater flooding, rainfall, property type, and land drainage information, to establish relative, but not absolute, risk of groundwater flooding at a resolution of greater than a few hundred metres. In all cases it is strongly recommend the confidence data is used in conjunction with the groundwater flooding susceptibility data. The susceptibility data should not be used on its own to make planning decisions at any scale, and, in particular, should not be used to inform planning decisions at the site scale. The susceptibility data cannot be used on its own to indicate risk of groundwater flooding."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Several coal resource maps for the whole of the UK have been produced by the British Geological Survey as a result of joint work with Department of Trade and Industry and the Coal Authority. The UK Coal Resource for new exploitation technologies map is a map of Britain depicting the spatial extent of the principal coal resources overlayed with existing workings and potential new technologies for accessing the resource. The map also shows the areas where coal and lignite are present at the surface and also where coal is buried at depth beneath younger rocks. The project covers all onshore coalfields in the UK, including Northern Ireland. It includes coal under estuaries and near-shore areas that can practically be reached by land-based directional drilling. No data more than 5 km offshore were considered. The maps are intended to be used for resource development, energy policy, strategic planning, land-use planning, the indication of hazard in mined areas, environment assessment and as a teaching aid. In addition to a summary map at 1:750000 scale for Britain data also exists for each technology of 21 individual regions or coal fields at a scale of 1:100000. The data was published in printed map form for the summary map, inkjet plots for the 42 individual maps and as PDF documents on CD. The maps were accompanied by BGS report CR/04/015N, \"UK Coal Resource for New Technologies, Final Report\". The work was initiated in April 2002 and completed in October 2003. The data was also simplified for inclusion in the Britain Beneath your Feet atlas 2005."@en ;

BGS co-funded this project through its Sustainable Mineral Solutions project. This work was completed in March 2008. This dataset comprises the digital GIS files which were produced through this project. The major elements of minerals information presented are the geological distribution of all mineral resources in the Central Belt of Scotland. The BGS Mineral Resource data does not determine mineral reserves and therefore does not denote potential areas of extraction. Only onshore, mainland mineral resources are included in the dataset. This dataset has been produced by the collation and interpretation of mineral resource data principally held by the British Geological Survey. The mineral resource data presented are based on the best available information, but are not comprehensive and their quality is variable. The dataset should only be used to show a broad distribution of those mineral resources which may be of current or potential economic interest. The data should not be used to determine individual planning applications or in taking decisions on the acquisition or use of a particular piece of land, although they may give useful background information which sets a specific proposal in context."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Data identifying landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with geological names and rock type descriptions. The scale of the data is 1:625 000 scale providing a simplified interpretation of the geology and may be used as a guide at a regional or national level, but should not be relied on for local geology. Onshore coverage is provided for all of England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. The bedrock geology of the UK is very diverse and includes three broad classes based on their mode of origin: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The data includes attribution to identify each rock type (in varying levels of detail) as described in the BGS Rock Classification Scheme (volumes 1-3 ). The bedrock has formed over long periods of geological time, from the Archean eon some 7500 million years ago, to the relatively young Pliocene, 58 million years ago. The age of the rocks is identified in the data through their BGS lexicon name (published for each deposit at the time of the original survey or subsequent digital data creation). For stratified rocks i.e. arranged in sequence, this will usually be of a lithostratigraphic type. Other rock types for example intrusive igneous bodies will be of a lithodemic type. More information on the formal naming of UK rocks is available in the BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition using visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. The data are available in vector format (containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes) as ESRI shapefiles and are delivered free of charge under the terms of the Open Government Licence."@en ;

    dcterms:description "A superficial thickness model covering England Scotland and Wales. The model is derived by direct modelling (natural neighbour interpolation) of BGS Borehole records and BGS Digmap. For the purposes of modelling, superficial deposits include sediments deposited during the Quaternary, subsequent Holocene rivers and coastal systems and also modern anthropogenic material. i.e. deposits that are less than 2.6 million years old. Grids are overprinted with a minimum value so that areas where no bore data is present, but superficial deposits are known to occur are given a minimum 1.5m thickness. The superficial thickness model has been created as baseline datasets for the BGS Information Products programme. The model provides only a simple, mathematical interpretation of reality with some phantom points that improve the model mainly in valley areas where lack of data was given different results as those expected by a geological interpretation of the area. The complexity of Superficial deposits in Great Britain is such that it is only possible to model indicative values of thickness and elevation. The models should never be used as a substitute for thorough site investigation."@en ;

The maps, originally compiled by the Minerals Division of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (CLGs historic predecessor), contain hand drawn boundaries for permitted, withdrawn and refused mineral planning permissions, and worked ground. They also contain hand drawn boundaries for land use at each site. These 'MHLG' maps show information collated from the 1940s (retrospectively to 1930) to the mid 1980s. The index cards provide supplementary information regarding name, operator, dates and relevant local authority. Data depicted on the maps are for England only and include; [a] all planning appeals, departures and called in cases whether permitted or refused; [b] all planning permission and refusal data for various local authority areas which were obtained by Departmental officials through visits to authorities in a staged programme spread over many years. Priority was placed on areas that were giving rise to then current casework issues thus at the time when the maintenance of the maps ended (mid 1985), some authority information had been updated recently but other areas had not been visited for many years. [c] land use present at each site. Categories include: derelict areas, restored quarries (filled and unfilled), tip heaps and spoil heaps, and wet areas. The variable completeness of the data sets should be kept in mind when this material is being used. Land use polygons have been digitised from the MHLG maps and attribute information has been provided from the map legend and the appropriate card in the card index. The principal aim of the data is to show land use present in areas of land that have been affected by the extraction of minerals."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Between 1976 and 1982, the Overseas Directorate of the British Geological Survey, United Kingdom and the Geological Survey of Bolivia, Santa Cruz, carried out a major reconnaissance geological mapping, geochemical sampling and mineral exploration programme of that part of the Precambrian Brazilian Shield lying within eastern Bolivia. Previous geological work had been undertaken in the area, but this was the first time that a systematic and fully integrated survey had been attempted. The Project area is approximately 220,000 square kilometres and regional geochemical samples were collected from 8185 sites producing an overall sampling density of 1 sample per 27 square kilometres. Because of logistic problems it was impossible to sample certain inaccessible areas so the actual sampling density was 1 sample per 16 square kilometres for the 130,000 square kilometres effectively sampled. The geochemical samples were analysed in the Project laboratories in Santa Cruz and in the GEOBOL geochemical laboratories in La Paz. Uranium analyses were carried out by a commercial laboratory in the UK. The results of the Project are incorporated in 21 comprehensive reports in both English and Spanish. Twelve describe the geology, geochemistry and mineral potential of the individual 1:250,000 map areas and the remainder are devoted to the geology and mineral potential of areas of special geological or economic interest. The stream sediments were determined for: Ag, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, U, B, Ba, Be, Cr, La, Li, Mo, Nb, Sn, Sr, Y, and Zr. These results are presented in an atlas as 22 single element 1:1 million scale, classed proportional symbol, point source data maps in which the symbols are overprinted on a simplified geological base map in order to facilitate rapid data interpretation. A 1:4 million scale moving average map based on a 4 x 4 km cell size and a 10 km search radius, printed alongside the symbol map, identifies the major regional variations. Raw data is available from the Geological Survey of Bolivia, Santa Cruz along with copies of the reports."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The 1:250k Geological Maps of Northern Ireland comprise the Superficial Deposits Map (Drift, 1991) and the Bedrock Map (Solid Geology, 1997). These maps identify landscape areas based on their lithology. The scale of the maps is 1:250 000 and provides a simplified interpretation of the geology that may be used as a guide at a regional level, but should not be relied on for local geology. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. The Superficial map shows the deposits within the extent of the six Counties of Northern Ireland. The Bedrock map comprises the bedrock geology and contains dykes and geological faults. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy of the rocks. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Dykes defines small, narrow areas of a specific type of bedrock geology; that is igneous rocks which have been intruded into the landscape at a later date than the surrounding bedrock. Geological faults occur where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by large scale processes affecting the earth's crust (tectonic forces). The Bedrock map shows the main bedrock geological divisions in Northern Ireland and coverage extends to the west into the Republic of Ireland. The printed map includes a stratigraphic column. Digital datasets have been derived from the maps and comprise three layers. 1. Superficial polygons, 2. Bedrock polygons and 3. Linear features. Attribute tables describe the polygon features.

    dcterms:description "The Samburu - Marsabit Geological Mapping and Mineral Exploration Project was a joint Kenyan and British technical co-operation project, carried out by staff of the Mines and Geological Department, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Kenya and staff from the British Geological Survey. The first phase of the project commenced in 1980, and covered the area between 36degrees and 38degrees E and from the equator to 2degrees N. The second phase, carried out between 1984 and 1986 covered the area between 36degrees and 38degrees E and from 2degrees N to the Ethiopian border. Sampling was carried out concurrently with geological mapping and was largely constrained by the requirements of that exercise. Little or no sampling was done in areas previously mapped by other bodies. Sampling was mainly confined to areas underlain by basement rocks of the Mozambique Belt and was very sparse over most of the Tertiary and Quaternary volcanic cover. Chemical analyses for the stream sediments were: Ag, Ba, Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn. Raw data is available from the Mines and Geological Survey Department, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Nairobi, Kenya. Sampling densities varied considerably across the Phase 1 project area, but generally a stream sediment sample density of one per 4 to 8 km2 and a panned concentrate density of one per 13 to 16 km2 was achieved. In the Phase 2 area, which was mainly very arid, a few samples were collected from dry stream beds, as part of a helicopter survey of the area, to provide some idea of the geochemistry of the major lithological units. Stream sediments were collected by combining grab samples from 5 to 10 points within a 10m radius of the selected site. If necessary the samples were dried before being sieved and the fine (-80 mesh B.S.) fraction retained for analysis. Heavy mineral concentrates were obtained by taking 2 to 5kg of material from the sample site and panning at the base camp, where water was available, or at the Mines and Geological Department headquarters at Nairobi."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Data identifying landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with geological names. The scale of the data is 1:50 000 scale. Onshore coverage is provided for all of England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Data are supplied as five themes: bedrock, superficial deposits, mass movement, artificial ground and linear features. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. Mass movement describes areas where deposits have moved down slope under gravity to form landslips. These landslips can affect bedrock, superficial or artificial ground. Mass movement deposits are described in the BGS Rock Classification Scheme Volume 4. However this data also includes foundered strata, where ground has collapsed due to subsidence (this is not described in the Rock Classification Scheme). Caution should be exercised with this data; historically BGS has not always recorded mass movement events and due to the dynamic nature of occurrence significant changes may have occurred since the data was released. Artificial (man-made) theme (shown as polygons) indicates areas where the ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. Whilst artificial ground may not be considered as part of the 'real geology' of bedrock and superficial deposits it does affect them. Artificial ground impacts on the near surface ground conditions which are important to human activities and economic development. Due to the constantly changing nature of land use and re-use/redevelopment, caution must be exercised when using this data as it represents a snapshot in time rather than an evolving picture hence the data may become dated very rapidly. Linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. Landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits. All five data themes are available in vector format (containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes) as ESRI shapefiles and are available under BGS data licence."@en ;

For Arsenic in soil data please see Geochemical Baseline Survey Of The Environment (G-BASE) For The UK ** Geochemical Baseline Survey Of The Environment (G-BASE) coverage for arsenic in soil. The G-BASE programme involves systematic sampling and the determination of chemical elements in samples of stream sediment, stream water and, locally, soil, to build up a picture of the surface chemistry of the UK. The average sample density for stream sediments and water is about one site per 1.5-2km square. Analytical precision is high with strict quality control to ensure countrywide consistency. Results have been standardised to ensure seamless joins between geochemical sampling campaigns. The data provide baseline information on the natural abundances of elements, against which anomalous values due to such factors as mineralisation and industrial contamination may be compared.

The dataset is a tool to indicate the location and productivity of bedrock aquifers across Scotland.

    dcterms:description "The British Geological Survey (BGS) was awarded a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government Aggregates Levy Fund in 2009 to provide a comprehensive, relevant and accessible information base to enhance the sustainability of mineral resources for Wales. BGS co-funded this project through its Sustainable Mineral Solutions project. This work was completed in 2010. This dataset comprises the digital GIS files which were produced through this project. The major elements of minerals information presented on the maps are; the geological distribution of all onshore mineral resources in Wales, the location of mineral extraction sites, the recorded occurrences of metallic minerals, the recorded location of former slate quarries and significant areas of slate waste and the recorded location of historic building stone quarries. The BGS Mineral Resource data does not determine mineral reserves and therefore does not denote potential areas of extraction. Only onshore, mainland mineral resources are included in the dataset. This dataset has been produced by the collation and interpretation of mineral resource data principally held by the British Geological Survey. The mineral resource data presented are based on the best available information, but are not comprehensive and their quality is variable. The dataset should only be used to show a broad distribution of those mineral resources which may be of current or potential economic interest. The data should not be used to determine individual planning applications or in taking decisions on the acquisition or use of a particular piece of land, although they may give useful background information which sets a specific proposal in context."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Radon is a natural radioactive gas, which enters buildings from the ground. The joint Public Health England (PHE) –British Geological Survey (BGS) digital dataset Radon Potential for Great Britain provides the current definitive map of radon Affected Areas in Great Britain. Exposure to high concentrations increases the risk of lung cancer. PHE (previously known as the Health Protection Agency or HPA) recommends that radon levels should be reduced in homes where the annual average is at or above 200 becquerels per cubic metre (200 Bq m-3). This is termed the Action Level. The PHE defines radon Affected Areas as those with 1% chance or more of a house having a radon concentration at or above the Action Level of 200 Bq m-3. The dataset allows an estimate to be made of the probability that an individual property is at or above the Action Level for radon. This information provides an answer to one of the standard legal enquiries on house purchase in England and Wales, known as CON29 standard Enquiry of Local Authority; 3.13 Radon Gas: Location of the Property in a Radon Affected Area. Radon Potential for Great Britain also provides information on the level of protection required for new buildings as described in the latest Building Research Establishment guidance on radon protective measures for new buildings (Radon: guidance on protective measures for new dwellings; BR 211, 2015 in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland). This radon potential hazard information for Great Britain is based on PHE indoor radon measurements and BGS digital geology information. This product was derived from BGS Geology 50 (formerly known as DigMap50 V3.14) and PHE in-house radon measurement data. The indoor radon data is used with the agreement of the PHE. Confidentiality of measurement locations is maintained through data management practices. Access to the data is under licence."@en ;

The interpretation was based on a variety of data sourced from within the British Geological Survey and externally. Data consulted includes archive sample and seismic records, side scan sonar, multibeam bathymetry and Olex datasets. The distribution of hard substrate at the seabed, or within 0.5 m is important in dictating the benthic assemblages found in certain areas. Therefore, an understanding of the distribution of these substrates is of primary importance in marine planning and designation of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) under the Marine and Coastal Access Act, 2009. In addition, a number of other users will value these data, including marine renewable companies, aggregate companies, the fishing and oil and gas industries. In order to address this issue it was necessary to update British Geological Survey sea-bed mapping to delineate areas where rock, boulders or cobbles are present at, or within 0.5m of the sea-bed surface. A polygon shape file showing areas of rock or hard substrate at, or within 0.5m of the sea-bed has been developed. The dataset has been created as vector polygons and are available in a range of GIS formats, including ArcGIS (.shp), ArcInfo Coverages and MapInfo (.tab).

The bedrock shown on GeoIndex map comprises the bedrock geology, which represents the outcrops (at surface) and subcrops (at near-surface, beneath superficial deposits) in Northern Ireland. For each rock unit there is a brief generalised description showing the major rock group, rock type and age under the following headings. LEX_D: The name of the selected area. This can be a group, formation or igneous intrusion e.g. dyke. LEX_RCS: Map code as it appears on the published 1:250,000 map. RCS_D: The name of the dominant types of rock (lithologies) in the different areas shown on the map e.g. granite. The names of the rock types given here are often generalisations, appropriate for the large areas of geological coverage at this scale. These areas may include a number of different geological formations whose distribution can only be portrayed on more detailed geological maps. RANK: Identifies formations and groups. Min_Time_D and Max_Tim_D: The age of the rock unit in terms of periods, relatively smaller units of geological time e.g. Carboniferous, Jurassic etc. Some of the map areas include rocks with a range of ages and these are shown as such e.g. Triassic to Cretaceous. The oldest metamorphic rocks are described as Moinian and Dalradian. The rocks range in age from those deposited relatively recently, some 2 million years ago, back to ancient and highly altered Precambrian rocks over 2500 million years old. In broad terms the youngest rocks are found in the south and east of the UK, the oldest in the north and west. VERSION: Version of the data. RELEASED: Date of release/update of the data. CAUTION Because of the generalisation and simplification used in the compilation of this map, it should not be used to determine the detailed geology of any specific sites.

The point source urban soil chemistry data comprises the locations and concentrations (mg kg-1) of Arsenic (As). Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni) and Lead (Pb) in urban topsoil samples. The Estimated Urban Soil Chemistry data indicates the estimated geometric mean concentrations (mg kg-1) of As, Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb in topsoil derived by spatial interpolation of the Point Source Urban Soil Chemistry data. Both urban soil chemistry datasets are derived from high resolution urban soil geochemical data from the BGS Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) project. The Urban Soil Chemistry data can be used to assist Local Planning Authorities to identify those areas where a risk assessment may need to be carried out by developers. Comparison of this spatially referenced geochemical data with information on current or historic land use and geological information might help environmental professionals decide whether high PHE concentrations in topsoils can be attributed to geogenic or anthropogenic sources.

This data was collected to better understand the low temperature cycling of Telurium (Te) and Sellenium (Se) in the geological environment. For example, a range of ochre samples were included in this data. Ochres are a modern precipitate commonly found in rivers and streams which flow through geographical areas with a history of mining resources which are rich in sulphides. Iron from the sulphides are leached out and deposited downstream, coating river and stream beds, giving a red, yellow or orange colouration. Ochres can be a sink for trace metals such as Te and Se, therefore studying these environments could be informative from a resource perspective but also from an environmental hazard perspective. This data would be useful for researchers who require reference photographs for similar studies or as an aid for resampling."@en ;

It incorporates the combined effects of the 6 GeoSure hazards on (low-rise) buildings: landslides, shrink-swell clays, soluble rocks, running sands, compressible ground and collapsible deposits. These hazards are evaluated using a series of processes including statistical analyses and expert elicitation techniques to create a derived product that can be used for insurance purposes such as identifying and estimating risk and susceptibility. The evaluated hazards are then linked to a postcode database - the Derived Postcode Database (DPD), which is updated biannually with new releases of Ordnance Survey Code-Point® data (current version used: 2020.1). The newGIP is provided for national coverage across Great Britain (not including the Isle of Man). This product is available in a range of GIS formats including Access (*.dbf), ArcGIS (*.shp) or MapInfo (*.tab). The newGIP is produced for use at 1:50 000 scale providing 50 m ground resolution."@en ;

These payments are (co)financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (‘EAGF’) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (‘EAFRD’).
To ensure that payments are regular, the CAP relies on the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), a set of comprehensive administrative and on the spot checks on subsidy applications, which is managed by the Member States. The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is a key component of the IACS. It is an IT system based on ortho imagery (aerial or satellite photographs) which records all agricultural parcels in the Member States. It serves two main purposes: to clearly locate all eligible agricultural land contained within reference parcels and to calculate their maximum eligible area (MEA). The LPIS is used for cross checking during the administrative control procedures and as a basis for on the spot checks by the paying agency."""@en ;

The ranges sampled are the Wassuk Range, White Range, Toiyabe Range, South Egan Range, Schell Range, Wheeler Range, House Range, Wasatch, Deep Greek, Ruby Range, Cortez Range, Humbolt Range, Dixie Valley, and Carson Range. Samples weigh approximately 2kg each. This sample coverage will constrain extension rates across the Basin and Range which is of interest to geologists, geodynamicists, and researchers interested in fault hazard."@en ;

    dcterms:description "This dataset presents meteorological records from 3 weather stations around a glacier in southeast Iceland from 2009-2020. The weather stations were installed as part of British Geological Survey’s Glacier Observatory project, and were positioned at different altitudes close to the ice to record glacier weather. The data is in text format, and records key meteorological parameters including temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar irradiance. The weather stations were placed around Virkisjökull-Falljökull, an outlet glacier of the Öraefajökull ice cap in south east Iceland (AWS1 at 16°48'19\"W, 63°57'53\"N; AWS3 at 16°47'5\"W, 63°58'13\"N, and AWS4 at 16°48'7\"W , 63°59'52\"N). AWS1 was installed in September 2009, with AWS3 installed in September 2010, and AWS4 in September 2011. AWS3 and AWS4 were decommissioned in August 2018, and AWS1 in May 2020. AWS1 was located 100m from the current glacier margin at 156m a.s.l.; AWS3 sat 50m from the icefall at 444m a.s.l.; and AWS4 was situated on a clifftop overlooking the glacier at 858m a.s.l., close to the Equilibrium Line Altitude of the glacier. These were positioned at different altitudes to determine changes in weather parameters with height, thus producing for example, temperature or humidity gradients. The three stations were wirelessly linked, allowing data from the upper stations to be offloaded to the datalogger on the lower station. On-site downloads were completed using Campbell Scientific LoggerNet 4.x series software. AWS1 maintained mobile phone telemetry enabling automatic remote downloads of data from all stations on a daily basis, and remote access for software updates and health checks. Each AWS supported a slightly different sensor array, depending on the requirements of the site, and were mounted on 1.5m Campbell Scientific tripods. All of the stations were designed around a Campbell Scientific CR800 datalogger, and were solar powered, using combinations of PV panels up to 100W, supplying a Campbell Scientific 25Ah battery mounted on the tripod, plus a 110Ah gel cell battery back up in a separate housing. The data will be of use to researchers and students interested in the weather of southeast Iceland, glacier climate, local influence of glaciers on more regional synoptic weather systems, glacier climate modellers, glacier hydrologists and hydrogeologists. The BGS project was led and coordinated by Dr Jez Everest, technical support and implementation by Heiko Buxel and data Quality Assurance and checking by Dr Jon Mackay. Any periods where equipment malfunction, testing or replacement meant that no or unreliable data were collected are indicated by a ‘NAN’ value in the datasets."@en ;

Whole-rock data taken by X-ray Florescence shows no systematic stratigraphic correlation. Chemical data for transects across, and spot points on, plagioclase phenocrysts, including some trace element data, all obtained using Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), with Backscatter electron (BSE) images of crystals, obtained using Scanning Electron Microscope, reveal complex zoning profiles. However, chemical data for transects across pyroxene phenocrysts, obtained using EPMA, show this phenocryst phase is largely unzoned. The dataset also includes chemical data for spots on Fe/Ti oxides, included on the rims of pyroxene, and obtained using EPMA. Matrix glass chemistry, obtained via EPMA, shows that the early eruptive ash is more evolved than the pyroclastic material that follows, and that there is a slight overall trend to a more homogenous, less evolved melt composition. The 1883 eruption of Krakatau was a large, cardera-forming eruption that caused approximately 36,000 fatalities. It is also the only eruption of its size to have accompanying written accounts."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The dataset is a Soil Corrosivity Map for the U.K. based on the BGS DIGMapGB-PLUS Map. The creation of this dataset involves scoring the Soil Parent Material types for five different attributes that contribute towards the corrosion of underground assets. These are (i) high or low soil pH, (ii) general soil moisture, (iii) the likelihood that soil saturated and undergo periods of anaerobic conditions, (iv) the presence of sulphides and sulphates and (v) the resistivity of the soil parent material. The scoring of each of these parameters was undertaken based on the Cast Iron Pipe Association (CIPA) (now the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, DIPRA) rating system. By combining the scores of each parameter a GIS layer has been created that identifies those areas that may provide a corrosive environment to underground cast iron assets. The final map has been classified into three categories signifying: 'GROUND CONDITIONS BENEATH TOPSOIL ARE UNLIKELY TO CAUSE CORROSION OF IRON', 'GROUND CONDITIONS BENEATH TOPSOIL MAY CAUSE CORROSION TO IRON', 'GROUND CONDITIONS BENEATH TOPSOIL ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE CORROSION TO IRON'. The dataset is designed to aid engineers and planners in the management of and maintenance of underground ferrous assets."@en ;

    dcterms:description "This dataset provides digital spatial information on the location of mineral resources in the central belt of Scotland at a scale of 1:50 000. The term ‘mineral resources’ has a definition under international standards that includes both an economic and geological dimension. These data are based primarily on mapped geology with limited assessment of economics. Therefore, the term ‘mineral resources’ is used here in a broad sense. The dataset allows users to visualise the extent and distribution of mineral resources and to relate them to other forms of land-use (such as urban areas or designated environmentally sensitive areas) or to other factors (such as transport infrastructure and conservation information). The British Geological Survey (BGS) was awarded a grant from the Scottish Government Aggregates Levy Fund in 2007 to provide a comprehensive, relevant and accessible information base to enhance the sustainability of mineral resources for 18 local authorities in the central belt of Scotland. BGS co-funded this project through its Sustainable Mineral Solutions project. This work was completed in March 2008. This dataset comprises the digital GIS files which were produced through this project.

The term ‘mineral resources’ has a definition under international standards that includes both an economic and geological dimension. These data are based primarily on mapped geology with limited assessment of economics. Therefore, the term ‘mineral resources’ is used here in a broad sense. The dataset allows users to visualise the extent and distribution of mineral resources and to relate them to other forms of land-use (such as urban areas or designated environmentally sensitive areas) or to other factors (such as transport infrastructure and conservation information). The British Geological Survey (BGS) was awarded a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government Aggregates Levy Fund in 2009 to provide a comprehensive, relevant and accessible information base to enhance the sustainability of mineral resources for Wales. BGS co-funded this project through its Sustainable Mineral Solutions project. This work was completed in 2010. This dataset comprises the digital GIS files which were produced through this project. The major elements of minerals information presented on the maps are; the geological distribution of all onshore mineral resources in Wales, the location of mineral extraction sites, the recorded occurrences of metallic minerals, the recorded location of former slate quarries and significant areas of slate waste and the recorded location of historic building stone quarries. In 2020 minor revisions to geometry and attributes were made in in response to minor corrections that were required. The paper maps were not re-released with these data updates. Point data for mineral occurrence and mine site data has not been included in this revision as these data are superseded by other BGS datasets, such as the BGS BritPits database of mines and quarries.

The dataset allows users to visualise the extent and distribution of mineral resources and to relate them to other forms of land-use (such as urban areas or designated environmentally sensitive areas) or to other factors (such as transport infrastructure and conservation information). The dataset is derived from a set of commissioned projects to prepare a series of mineral resource maps based on counties or amalgamations of counties. Maps for England were commissioned by the central government department with responsibility for mineral planning at the time (Department of the Environment (DoE), Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR), Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), and the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) between 1994 and 2006. Each map produced (with an accompanying report describing the mineral resources depicted on the map) is available to download, as a PDF file from the BGS-hosted website: www.MineralsUK.com. During 2011-2012 revisions were made to areas of the resource linework. These changes were made as a result of new research and release of a new version of DiGMap (v5).

    dcterms:description "BGS GeoSure identifies, at 1:50 000 scale, areas of susceptibility and considers the following specific hazard processes that can occur in Great Britain: 1. Shrink–Swell: Swelling clays change in volume due to changes in water content; this can lead to movements (up or down) in the upper two metres of the ground, which may affect property foundations. 2. Landslides (Slope Instability): Slope instability occurs when particular slope characteristics combine to make the slope unstable. Downslope movement of materials (landslide) may cause damage to foundations, services or impact damage to buildings. 3. Soluble Rocks (Dissolution): Ground dissolution occurs when certain types of rocks, containing layers of soluble material, get wet and the soluble material dissolves. This can cause underground cavities to develop. These cavities reduce support to the ground above and can lead to a collapse of overlying rocks. 4. Compressible Ground: Some types of ground may contain layers of very weak materials such as peat or some types of poorly structured clays. These may compress if loaded by overlying structures, or if the groundwater level changes. This compression may result in depression of the ground surface, potentially disturbing foundations and services. 5. Collapsible Deposits: Some soils may collapse when a load (building or road traffic) is placed on them, especially if they become saturated. Such collapse may cause damage to overlying property or services. 6. Running Sand: Some rocks and soils can contain loosely packed sandy layers that can become fluidised by water flowing through them. Such sands can ‘run’ (flow), potentially removing support from overlying buildings and causing damage."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The property subsidence assessment dataset provides an understanding of the shrink-swell hazard at both the individual property and/or postcode level for England and Wales. It builds upon the BGS GeoSure shrink-swell data by mapping the hazard to the individual building polygon and considering the other susceptibility factors of building type, foundation depth, and drainage and tree proximity. The data consist of GIS building polygons with an overall susceptibility to subsidence score between 1-100. Scores are also classified from non-plastic to very high. Each building polygon is also scored from 1-10 for each subsidence factor (geology, foundation, drainage, building type, building storey and tree proximity). Postcode data is also available as a table showing the ‘average’ PSA score for all buildings within the postcode. The identification of shrink-swell related subsidence prone areas, alongside the inclusion of potential sources to exacerbate these phenomena, can better inform insurers and homeowners and form the basis to make decisions concerning prevention and remediation. The product enhances geological information obtained from GIP (BGS GeoSure Insurance Product) and GeoSure via the inclusion of the crucial shrink-swell susceptibility factors (proximity to trees and foundation depth). This therefore allows the derivation of a risk element for the housing stock at Building level, which is then generalised to Postcode level.

    dcterms:description "The BGS Permeability Index dataset shows estimated rates of water movement from the ground surface to the water table. The v8 dataset incorporates the latest geology mapping (BGS Geology 50k). This includes updates to the lithology-coding schema, the LEX_RCS. A 2-part code used to identify the named rock unit from the BGS lexicon of named rock units (LEX) followed by a Rock Classification Scheme (RCS) code which describes the rocks lithological characteristics e.g. texture and composition. Updates to these codes and latest dissolution hazard data sourced from BGS GeoSure: Soluble Rocks have been reviewed and classified as part of the version 8 release. The dataset covers Great Britain and is presented at a scale of 1:50 000, based on the geological data at the same scale. However, in areas where the geology is not mapped to this scale, the next best available scale is used. The BGS Permeability Index can be used to compare the relative permeability of deposits at the regional scale, indicating where highly permeable rocks could allow rapid infiltration to occur, or where less permeable rocks are present and water could pond on the ground surface. The dataset can be used as a component in a wide range of geo-environmental assessments such as natural flood management, Sustainable Drainage Systems, engineering desk studies, slope stability, and aquifer vulnerability. It is for use at the regional scale and is not recommended for use at the site-specific scale."@en ;

The Floods Directive also allows Member States to identify different units of management from the river basin districts used for the Water Framework Directive.

Member States shall (Article 3 of the Floods Directive):
(a) appoint competent authorities different from those identified pursuant to Article 3(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC;
(b) identify certain coastal areas or individual river basins and assign them to a unit of management different from those assigned pursuant to Article 3(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC.

In these cases, Member States shall, by 26 May 2010, communicate to the Commission the information referred to in Annex I to Directive 2000/60/EC.
Any changes in administrative arrangements also need to be communicated within three months of the change coming into effect.

The first spreadsheet contains information on the chemical composition of 98 surface water samples (84 samples and 14 field duplicates) collected monthly for 14 months between February 2019 and March 2020 from six sampling locations. These comprised three on the River Clyde at the UKGEOS Glasgow Cuningar Loop borehole cluster and three from control sites (two on the River Clyde and one on the Tollcross Burn). Field measurements of pH, redox potential, specific electrical conductance, temperature, dissolved oxygen and alkalinity and laboratory chemical data for concentrations of 71 inorganic and 10 organic substances in the surface water samples are presented. The dataset contains locational and descriptive information about the samples also. The analyte name, element chemical symbols, analytical method, units of measurement and long-term limits of detection are recorded in header rows at the top of the spreadsheet. The limits of detection/quantification for each monthly batch of samples are documented in rows at the head of each batch. The dataset includes abbreviations documenting quality control issues such as missing values. A guide to abbreviations used in the dataset is provided in the second excel spreadsheet released with the data.

    dcterms:description "This dataset contains dissolved methane concentrations from groundwater in Great Britain, predominantly from England. Data were collated in Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) format from four publicly accessible sources: the British Geological Survey (from Bell et al., 2017), the Environment Agency for England (from the online Water Quality Archive), and local baseline data for the shale gas sites of Preston New Road (from Cuadrilla Resources) and Kirby Misperton (from Third Energy). In total, 2997 dissolved methane concentrations are included in the dataset and were collected from 922 unique locations from October 1992 to July 2018. The data were used within a Bayesian framework to create a dynamic baseline (a baseline that can change in time and space to reflect ongoing environmental change) that can predict the probability that a change in dissolved methane concentration has occurred, for example in the context of monitoring aquifers at shale gas sites using hydraulic fracturing methods. The data presented are the underlying dataset to Wilson et al., 2020, Science of the Total Environment: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134854. Bell, R. A., Darling, W. G., Ward, R.

    dcterms:description "On December 1, 1965, an underground blowout during an exploratory drill with a catastrophic outcome occurred near Sleen, The Netherlands. During approximately 2.5 months, near-continuous leakage of large amounts of natural gas was released into the subsurface. After the blowout, the local drinking water production company installed a network of groundwater monitoring wells to monitor for possible adverse effects on groundwater quality at the blowout site. Today, more than 50 years after the blowout, the groundwater is still impaired. Data has been correlated with previously published data by Schout et al. (2018) covering description of geology and well depths. During October 2019 we sampled from 12 groundwater wells covering: - Inorganic parameters (hydrocarbons, anions, cations, DOC, alkalinity, nitrate and ammonium) - DNA (quantification of total bacteria by qPCR 16S, aerobic methane oxidation by qPCR pmoA, and anaerobic methane oxidation by qPCR mcrA) The dataset was created within SECURe project (Subsurface Evaluation of CCS and Unconventional Risks) - https://www.securegeoenergy.eu/.

    dcterms:description "This dataset is the output of a NERC fellowship aimed to understand the long-term dynamics of tropical vegetation through palaeoecological analysis. For doing this, two sedimentary archives (Laguna Pindo and Laguna Baños) from Ecuador were radiocarbon dated and analysed for pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal, chironomids, stable isotopes and XRF of tephra deposits. Each proxy was analysed at different resolution. Laguna Pindo is a mid-elevation lake (1250 m asl) that spans the last 50,000 years. Laguna Baños is an Andean lake located at 3800 m asl and contains sediments representative of the last 6500 years. Both water bodies are very shallow. The data is presented mainly in excel spreadsheets as raw data (except for radiocarbon dating data, which are the PDF files provided by NRCF and are available in the NGDC), without any math treatment or conversion (unless specified). NERC fellowship is NE/J 018562/1."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios (δ18O, δ13C) were measured on 10 to 12 shells of mixed-layer dwelling species Globigerinoides subquadratus from the 250 to 315 μm size fraction from 425 meters composite depth (mcd) until its extinction at 390 mcd. Analyses then continue with Globigerinoides spp. until 350 mcd. In a few samples, where foraminiferal density was low, only 5–7 specimens were analyzed. Analyses were made with a VG Optima mass spectrometer with multi prep device at the British Geological Survey, Keyworth, UK. When picking shells, care was taken to exclude individuals with broken or missing chambers, although preservation of specimens was generally excellent (Fox & Wade, 2013). The external reproducibility of our measurements is ±0.07‰ and ±0.05‰ for δ18O and δ13C respectively. To examine the reproducibility of the results, duplicate measurements were made on 35 samples (5%), which indicate mean reproducibility better than ±0.12‰ and ±0.14‰ for δ18O and δ13C, respectively. Oxygen isotope data are reported as per mil on the VPDB scale (Table S1) calibrated through laboratory and international standards. At ODP Site 1146, δ18O and δ13C were measured by Holbourn et al., (2010) on the mixed-layer dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides obliquus or Gs. subquadratus, using 10 to 20 well-preserved tests from the size fraction 250-350 μm. Paired measurements in 51 samples indicate no significant offset in δ18O and δ13C between Gs. obliquus and Gs. subquadratus. Detailed methods are outlined in Holbourn et al., (2010). δ13C data are not used here. For Mg/Ca analyses, we selected 25–35 specimens of Trilobatus quadrilobatus (140–550 μg) from the 250 to 315 μm size fraction; the same size fraction as used for δ18O analysis, to minimize size-related intraspecific elemental variation (Elderfield et al., 2002). Analyses were performed on 86 samples over the studied interval. The tests were gently crushed and subsequently cleaned according to the protocol of Martin & Lea (2002) to remove clays. Cleaning included a reductive step with hydrazine to remove Mn-(hydr)oxides. Samples were measured on an ICP-AES device at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany. Analytical precision is ~1.1%, based on measurements of an internal laboratory standard. Replicate Mg/Ca measurements revealed an average standard deviation of ~0.08 mmol/mol. Adequate cleaning is indicated by very low Fe/Ca, Al/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The dataset contains geochemical measurements which quantify the amount and source of carbon in organic matter of sediments from Lake Paringa, New Zealand. Measurements were made on a 6 m sediment core collected in 2015 from the lake bed using a Mackereth corer (PA6m1a). The core was correlated to master core PA1 which has a well-established age-depth model based on accelerator mass spectrometry measurements of the radiocarbon (14C) content of terrestrial macrofossils (Howarth et al., 2016). In addition, soil samples were collected using a soil auger from two elevation transects in westland, New Zealand in 2016 and 2017 (from Mt. Fox and Alex Knob). All sediment samples were freeze dried and ground to homogenise them prior to geochemical analyses. Organic carbon concentration (%) and the stable isotopic composition of organic carbon (δ13C) was measured (Frith et al., 2018) following the removal of carbonate minerals (0.25 M hydrochloric acid for 4 hours at approximately 70 °C) by combustion of sediment at 1,020 °C in a Costech Elemental Analyser coupled via a CONFLO III to a Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage stable isotope mass spectrometer. Total nitrogen content (N, %) and its isotopic composition (δ15N) was measured by combustion of untreated samples in a Costech Elemental Analyser with a CARBOSORB trap to inhibit large CO2 peaks from affecting measurements. A subset of samples were selected for analysis of the radiocarbon activity (14C, reported as F14C) of bulk organic matter by accelerator mass spectrometry after graphitization. A subset of sediment samples from the lake core and soil samples were selected for the analysis of biomarker abundance and their hydrogen isotope composition. We focused on the extraction of n-alkanes from aliquots of lake sediment (~2 g) using established methods (Wang et al., 2020). These measurements are reported in the dataset as the abundance of n-alkanes (chain lengths C21 to C35) in ug/g of sediment (and sum of chain lengths and ratios - carbon preference index). Finally, the dataset includes outputs of organic matter provenance: modelled elevation and depth, as described in Wang et al., (2020). In the datafile, the sample elevation and depth are provided. The labels for data are as follows. For down core sediment samples from Lake Paringa, they are labelled with the core code (PA6m1), and the sampling interval in centimetres (PA6m1_x). Soil samples from an elevation transect from Mt Fox (MF-YY-a) are labelled with a distinct code for each site (YY) and sub-code for each soil depth (a). Soil samples from an elevation transect of Alex Knob (5.Z.z) are labelled based on sub-site (Z) and soil depth (z)."@en ;

These were collected on the RV JOIDES Resolution. Shipboard biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy suggests the samples are mainly early Miocene in age (McKay et al., 2019). The uppermost samples do, however, include younger Plio-Pleistocene sediments. Neodymium and Sr isotope analyses were conducted using a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and a thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS), respectively, in the MAGIC laboratories at Imperial College London. Neodymium and Sr isotopes in sediments can be compared to measurements from terrestrial rock samples, allowing the changing provenance of the sediments to be traced. This dataset therefore provides information on how erosion by Antarctica’s ice sheets bordering the Ross Sea has changed over time. Neodymium isotopes are reported in the epsilon notation, which denotes the deviation in parts per 10,000 from the present-day composition of the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir (143Nd/144Nd = 0.512638) (Jacobsen and Wasserburg, 1980)."@en ;

The data are in Excel spreadsheets and record cyanobacteria fluorescence, the presence of chlorophyll a and exocellular polysaccharide, soil surface strength, particle size distribution and soil loss by wind erosion. The study was located within Diamantina National Park (23°36’44.8”S; 143°17’46.9”E) in the north-eastern part of the Lake Eyre basin, central Australia. Site characteristics are 1/A physical depositional crust; 2/B cyanobacterial crust on dune flank; 3/D cyanobacterial crust on claypan; 4/E physical structural crust; 5/C cyanobacterial crust on nebkha field. Different amounts of rainfall were applied using Griffith University Mobile Rainfall Simulator (see Bullard et al. 2018 for technical details). Following rainfall and drying in situ of the surface, wind erosion was measured using a portable mini-wind tunnel (see Strong et al. 2016 for technical details). The data will be of value for understanding cyanobacterial response to different rainfall amounts and wind speeds under future climate scenarios.

The survey provides a modern analogue to tectonics hypothesized to have occurred across the Iapetus suture zone of northern England 450-400 Ma. The Banda Arc of Indonesia near the island of Timor is widely recognized as the premier example of the active subduction of continental crust and lithosphere beneath oceanic lithosphere. The crossing of a modern island arc and close passage to active volcanoes was intended to image reflections associated with magma in the crust and uppermost mantle."@en ;

The aim was to acquire high quality data to enable broad scale characterisation of the seabed habitats, their biological communities and potential historic environment assets. The surveys were conducted in the following areas - Outer Bristol Chanel (2003 – 2005), Eastern English Channel (2005 – 2006), South Coast (2007 - 2010), Outer Thames (2007), East Coast (2008 - 2009), Humber (2008 - 2009). The Geology and Geophysics component of the data are archived by British Geological Survey (BGS) in the Marine Environmental data and Information Network (MEDIN) Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. The data includes bathymetry, sidescan sonar, sub-bottom profiler, magnetometer, seabed video and photographs, Particle Size Analysis (PSA) data, vibrocore (logs and images). Data are delivered via the BGS Offshore GeoIndex www.bgs.ac.uk/GeoIndex/offshore.htm. Additional data are available on request enquiries@bgs.ac.uk. Other data types have been archived with the other MEDIN DACs as appropriate (UKHO DAC for bathymetry data and DASSH DAC for biological data).

    dcterms:description "The measurements and data were obtained to study the release of carbon dioxide during the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, and how these CO2 fluxes were related to environmental parameters (temperature, hydrology). Weathering of sedimentary rocks can result in CO2 release from the oxidation of rock organic carbon oxidation, but also due to the oxidation of sulfide minerals, production of sulfuric acid and subsequent release of CO2 from carbonate minerals. The rock-derived carbon sources are understudied, and form an important part of the geological carbon cycle. The CO2 flux measurements were made on 5 rock chambers (H4, H6, H7, H8 and H13) installed in the Draix-Bleone Critical Zone Observatory, France, on outcrops of Jurassic marls. Measurements and data were collected from December 2016 to May 2019. Regular visits to the site (~4 per year) returned data on total CO2 flux (Total-CO2-flux.csv). This was explored as a function of temperature and ambient hydroclimate (precipitation). The datasets include the total CO2 flux measured at each visit to a chamber, and measurements of the internal chamber temperature. To determine the source of CO2 measured in the chambers, we trapped the CO2 using zeolite sieves and recovered it in the laboratory. The radiocarbon activity (reported as fraction modern, F14C) and its stable isotope composition (d13C) were measured from CO2 collected from chambers H4 and H6 over the sampling period (Radiocarbon-data.csv). These were used in a mixing analysis to partition the source of CO2 using a mixing model approach (Partitioned-CO2-fluxes.csv) as explained in full in the published paper Soulet et al., 2021, Nature Geoscience. We also measured the geochemical characteristics of the bedrocks being measured (rock-geochemical-composition.csv), including the organic carbon concentration, inorganic carbon concentration and their isotopic composition. Finally, we measured environmental variables of interest - the chamber temperature and the air temperature at the Draix-Bleone observatory (chamber-temperature.csv and Air-temperature-at-laval-le-plateau-weather-station.csv, respectively). This research was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, (NERC Environmental Isotope Facility NEIF Radiocarbon Allocation 2074.1017) to Guillaume Soulet, Robert Hilton and Mark Garnett. Full details of data analysis and interpretation can be found in Soulet et al., 2021, Temperature control on CO2 emissions from the weathering of sedimentary rocks, Nature Geoscience"@en ;

Core MD04-2832 was collected from the middle basin of Loch Sunart a fjord on the west coast of Scotland from the research vessel Marion Dufresne on the 15th of June 2004. This data resource includes five data sheets: (1) Geochemical data, (2) Bulk radiocarbon, (3) ICP-MS, (4) FRUITS and (5) Age Model. 1. Geochemical data sheet includes Bulk elemental data (Organic Carbon, Nitrogen, C/N ratio, N/C ratio), Isotopic data (δ13C and ẟ15N), Biomarker data (Alkanes, Fatty Acids, GDGT's) and thermosgravimetric data (% labile, recalcitrant and refractory organic matter). 2. Bulk Radiocarbon data sheet includes bulk radiocarbon data for ten sediment samples presented as % modern, 14C Age (years BP), ẟ14C and Δ14C. 3. ICP-MS data sheet includes metal data associated with mining activities within the fjords catchment. Data includes Zinc (Zn), Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu), Barium (Ba), Aluminium (Al) and elemental ratios of these metal normalized with Al concentrations. 4. The FRUITS data sheet contains the outputs from the FRUITS Bayesian isotopic mixing model (Fernandes et al., 2014) used to constrain the source (terrestrial vs marine) of the organic carbon found at site MD04-2832. The model used bulk elemental ratios (N/C), Isotopic (δ13C and ẟ15N) and biomarker data (GDGT - BIT Index) to calculate the terrestrial and marine OC fraction from each downcore sample. 5. The Age Model datasheet contains the age model produced by the BACON software package (Blaauw and Christen, 2011). The age model was developed with a combination of shell/foraminifera radiocarbon dates and radiometric dating (210Pb and 137Cs). Further details on the data can be found in Smeaton, C., Cui, X., Bianchi, T.S., Cage, A.G., Howe J.A., Austin, W.E.N., (2021), The evolution of a coastal carbon store over the last millennium, Quaternary Science Reviews."@en ;

The excel file consists of two tabs both containing groundwater level data (in metres below ground level) and location information. In the first tab (Full_dataset), which contains the full dataset, there are 68783 rows of observed groundwater level data from 4028 individual sites. In the second tab (LTS) there are 7547 rows of groundwater level observations from 130 individual sites, which have water level data available for a period of more than 40 years and from which at least two thirds of the annual observations are available."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The measurements and data contained here were obtained to study the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, and more specifically the oxidation of rock organic carbon and the associated release of CO2. The primary aim was to better understand the production and mobility of the trace element rhenium during weathering, because this element has been proposed as a proxy for rock organic carbon oxidation. The study focused on three Alpine catchments that drain sedimentary rocks, which all experience moderate to high erosion rates where oxidative weathering rates are thought to operate faster. Two catchments were located in Switzerland - the Erlenbach and Vogelbach, and one catchment in Colorado, USA - the East River. To study chemical weathering and the production and mobility of rhenium, a suite of samples were collected to capture the source and products of weathering reactions. These focused on stream and river water, river sediments and weathering profiles collected on sedimentary rocks. The Swiss catchments, water samples were collected from 2011 and 2012 to capture changes in river flow and seasonal changes in hydro-climate. Samples were collected from a gauging station operated by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research - WSL. In the East River, samples were collected from the gauging station operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area from 2015 and 2016. Additional samples included snow samples collected from the Erlenbach. All water samples were analysed for their major dissolved ion content by Ion Chromatography. Dissolved rhenium concentrations were determined by High Resolution and Quadrupole Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Solid samples were digested and analysed for Re content by ICP-MS. These geochemical measurements were paired with water discharge data to quantify the flux of dissolved elements, using rating curves and flux-weighted average methods, and interpret the hydrological context of ion production and mobility through the landscape. This new data acquisition was funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant to Robert Hilton (ROC-CO2 project, grant 678779) and a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK, Standard Grant (NE/I001719/1). Further details of subsequent data analysis and interpretation can be found in Hilton, R.G., et al., 2021, Concentration-discharge relationships of dissolved rhenium in Alpine catchments reveal its use as a tracer of oxidative weathering, Water Resources Research"@en ;

    dcterms:description "This dataset consists of reconstructions of daily groundwater levels for eight boreholes in Burkina Faso. Data for each borehole is provided in an individual csv file, with reconstructed groundwater level time series reported in metres above sea level (GWL, mASL). The groundwater level reconstructions were derived in 2019 as a part of the BRAVE project (NE/M008827/1 and NE/M008983/1) to develop an improved understanding of temporal variability in groundwater levels in sub-Saharan Africa. The reconstructions were derived using the lumped conceptual groundwater model AquiMod. Observed groundwater level time series for the eight boreholes were modelled using AquiMod, and the calibrated models were used with historic precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data to derive the reconstructions. The length of the time series of reconstructed groundwater levels varies between the boreholes due to differences in the length of the precipitation time series used to derive the reconstructions.

    dcterms:description """This dataset is on children (persons aged less than 18 years) in judicial proceedings in United Kingdom. Judicial proceedings are those taking place in court as a part of the justice systems in Member States or proceedings that are alternatives to judicial proceedings. The data concerns the child in different roles, such as suspect/offender, witness, victim, plaintiff or otherwise the subject of judicial proceedings. \r
\r
The dataset is organised according to the theme from the Masterlist. You can filter this dataset according to key word searches, whether the data provides disaggregation by the age of child, sex, region within country or socio-economic group and by source. The listing of national datasets indicates whether the information provided is equivalent or approximate to the Masterlist indicators. \r
\r
You are able to access the raw data and metadata. \r
\r
The national contextual overview describes the national legal and policy framework with regard to children's involvement in criminal judicial proceedings as at 1 June 2012. \r

    dcterms:description """In its policy, the European Union intervenes when necessary to prevent conflict or in response to emerging or actual crises. In certain cases, EU intervention can take the form of restrictive measures or 'sanctions'. The application of financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets constitutes an obligation for both the public and private sector. In this regard, a particular responsibility falls on credit and financial institutions, since they are involved in the bulk of financial transfers.\r
\r
In order to facilitate the application of financial sanctions, the European Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of Co-operative Banks, the European Association of Public Banks ("the EU Credit Sector Federations") and the European Commission recognised the need for an EU consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets. The Credit Sector Federations set up an initial database containing the consolidated list. The European Commission subsequently took over this database and is responsible for its maintenance and for keeping the consolidated list of sanctions up-to-date. In this respect, the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) of the European Commission launched a new Web page in June 2017, where the consolidated lists of financial sanctions consisting in freezing of assets are published in different formats (see link below).\r
\r
Disclaimer: While every effort is made to ensure that the database and the consolidated list correctly reproduce all relevant data of the officially adopted texts published in the Official Journal of the European Union, neither the Commission nor the EU Credit Sector Federations accepts any liability for possible omissions of relevant data or mistakes, and nor for any use the database or of the consolidated list. Only the information published in the Official Journal of the EU is deemed authentic. """@en ;

    dcterms:description "     This country codes authority table is intended to provide a code related to the names of the countries – in a short and in a long form – in the 24 official languages of the European Union.These codes are used for the documentary metadata and may present slight differences with those used for the production of documents at a stylistic level.The \"Authority code\" relays on the ISO 3166-1/alpha-3 positions. If the ISO code doesn't exist, an alpha-numeric code is created. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are also offered as from 1950 till now with the date(s) of event(s).A country code comparison is provided between ISO codes, IANA codes (Internet ccTLDS – Country-code Top-level Domains), and TIR (Transport International par la Route) Vehicle system codes.Codes marked in italic are obsolete and should not be used, excepted in the case of back-log work.ISO 3166 is the International standard for country codes. The purpose of ISO 3166 is to establish codes for the representation of names of countries. This standard exists in three forms:ISO 3166-1 (2006) contains a two-letter code which is recommended as the general purpose code, a three-letter code which has better mnenomic properties and a numeric-3 code which can be useful if script independence of the codes is important.ISO 3166-2 (2007) gives codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. This code is based on the two-letter code element from ISO 3166-1 followed by a separator and a further string of up to three alphanumeric characters.ISO 3166-3 (1999) contains a four-letter code for those country names which have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 since its first publication in 1974. The code elements for formerly used country names have a length of four alphabetical characters (alpha-4 code elements).The ISO 3166-1 is also used by the EU Geonomenclature of the Statistical Office, the UN/LOCODE, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Internet Assigned Authority Numbers (IANA) and more other organisations.

\r
On 12 February 2020, the novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while the disease associated with it is now referred to as COVID-19. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, ECDC’s Epidemic Intelligence team has been collecting on daily basis the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports from health authorities worldwide.  To insure the accuracy and reliability of the data, this process is being constantly refined. This helps to monitor and interpret the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic not only in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), but also worldwide. Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures. The data screening is followed by ECDC’s standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the [ECDC website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic), ensuring a maximum level of transparency. \r
\r
ECDC switched to a weekly reporting schedule for the COVID-19 situation worldwide and in the EU/EEA and the UK on 17 December 2020. Hence, all daily updates have been discontinued from 14 December. The weekly data can be found in the dataset [COVID-19 Coronavirus data - weekly (from 17 December 2020)](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/covid-19-coronavirus-data-weekly-from-17-december-2020?locale=en).\r

<http://data.europa.eu/88u/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data-weekly-from-17-december-2020> a dcat:Dataset ;
    dcterms:description """The dataset contains a weekly situation update on COVID-19, the epidemiological curve and the global geographical distribution (EU/EEA and the UK, worldwide). \r
\r
Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, ECDC’s Epidemic Intelligence team has collected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports from health authorities worldwide. This comprehensive and systematic process was carried out on a daily basis until 14/12/2020.\r
See the discontinued daily dataset: [COVID-19 Coronavirus data - daily](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/covid-19-coronavirus-data?locale=en).\r
ECDC’s decision to discontinue daily data collection is based on the fact that the daily number of cases reported or published by countries is frequently subject to retrospective corrections, delays in reporting and/or clustered reporting of data for several days. Therefore, the daily number of cases may not reflect the true number of cases at EU/EEA level at a given day of reporting. Consequently, day to day variations in the number of cases does not constitute a valid basis for policy decisions. \r
\r
ECDC continues to monitor the situation. Every week between Monday and Wednesday, a team of epidemiologists screen up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures for publication on Thursday. The data screening is followed by ECDC’s standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of transparency.\r
\r
ECDC receives regular updates from EU/EEA countries through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), The European Surveillance System (TESSy), the World Health Organization (WHO) and email exchanges with other international stakeholders. This information is complemented by screening up to 500 sources every day to collect COVID-19 figures from 196 countries. This includes websites of ministries of health (43% of the total number of sources), websites of public health institutes (9%), websites from other national authorities (ministries of social services and welfare, governments, prime minister cabinets, cabinets of ministries, websites on health statistics and official response teams) (6%), WHO websites and WHO situation reports (2%), and official dashboards and interactive maps from national and international institutions (10%). In addition, ECDC screens social media accounts maintained by national authorities on for example Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or Telegram accounts run by ministries of health (28%) and other official sources (e.g. official media outlets) (2%). Several media and social media sources are screened to gather additional information which can be validated with the official sources previously mentioned. Only cases and deaths reported by the national and regional competent authorities from the countries and territories listed are aggregated in our database.\r
\r
 \r
\r
Disclaimer: National updates are published at different times and in different time zones. This, and the time ECDC needs to process these data, might lead to discrepancies between the national numbers and the numbers published by ECDC. Users are advised to use all data with caution and awareness of their limitations. Data are subject to retrospective corrections; corrected datasets are released as soon as processing of updated national data has been completed.\r

Therefore, unlike registers of credit institutions maintained at national level, this Register has no legal significance and confers no rights in law. If an unauthorised institution is inadvertently included in the Register, its legal status is in no way altered; similarly, if an institution has inadvertently been omitted from the Register, the validity of its authorisation will not be affected.\r
\r
With regard to entries in the column headed 'Legal form', which are, by their very nature, in most cases untranslatable, it should be pointed out that terminological similarities are not to be taken to indicate that the legal status is the same. With regard to entries in the column headed 'Deposit Guarantee Scheme', it should also be pointed out that the fact that a credit institution is covered by a particular deposit guarantee scheme does not necessarily imply that all types or amounts of deposits are eligible for compensation under the scheme. This will depend on the rules applicable to the deposit guarantee scheme, as set out in Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes and the national rules that have implemented this Directive.\r

    dcterms:description "In 2011 the British Geological Survey (BGS) decided to begin the assembly of a National Geological Model (NGM) from its existing and on-going geological framework models , comprising integrated national crustal, bedrock and Quaternary models. The bedrock component is the most advanced of these themes and comprises both the calculated models and a complementary network of cross-sections that provide a fence diagram for the bedrock geology of Great Britain. This fence diagram, the GB3D_v2012 dataset is available in a variety of formats from the BGS website www.bgs.ac.uk as free downloads. It complements the existing 1:625 000 scale mapsheets published by BGS utilising the same colour schema and geological classification. The 121 component cross-sections extend to depths between 1.5 and 6 km; they have an aggregate length of over 20,000 km, and they are snapped together at their intersections to ensure total consistency. The sections are based on the existing BGS geological framework models where they cut through them, they also take account of the vast wealth of published data on the subsurface structure of Britain both from BGS and in the literature. Much of this is in the form of cross-sections, contour maps of surfaces, and thicknesses (isopachs). The fence diagram has been built in the Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3D (GSI3D) software. It is envisaged that this dataset will form a useful educational resource for geoscience students and the general public, and also provide the bedrock geology context and structure for regional and catchment scale studies. The fence diagram was built in 2009-12 using funding from the BGS National Capability Programme and the Environment Agency of England and Wales. 14 expert regional geologists compiled the sections."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Subsurface 3D geological models of aquifer and seal rock systems from two contrasting analogue sites have been created as the first step in an investigation into methodologies for geological storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. Development of the models illustrates the utility of an integrated approach using digital techniques and expert geological knowledge to further geological understanding. The models visualize a faulted, gently dipping Permo-Triassic succession in Lincolnshire and a complex faulted and folded Devono-Carboniferous succession in eastern Scotland. The Permo-Triassic is present in the Lincolnshire model to depths of -2 km OD, and includes the aquifers of the Sherwood Sandstone and Rotliegendes groups. Model-derived thickness maps test and refine Permian palaeogeography, such as the location of a carbonate reef and its associated seaward slope, and the identification of aeolian dunes. Analysis of borehole core samples established average 2D porosity values for the Rotliegendes (16%) and Sherwood Sandstone (20%) groups, and the Zechstein (5%) and Mercia Mudstone (<10%) groups, which are favourable for aquifer and seal units respectively. Core sample analysis has revealed a complex but wellunderstood diagenetic history. Re-interpretation of newly reprocessed seismic data in eastern Scotland has significantly reduced interpretative uncertainty of aquifer and seal units at depths of up to -6 km OD in a complex faulted and folded Devonian-Carboniferous succession. Synthesis of diverse data in the 3D geological model defines a set of growth folds and faults indicative of active Visean to Westphalian dextral-strike slip, with no major changes in structural style throughout the Carboniferous, in contrast to some published tectonic models. Average 2D porosity values are 14-17% in aquifer units and <2% in the seal unit, with a ferroan dolomite cement occluding porosity at depth."@en ;

These two components can fulfil several public health objectives, notably as an indicator of the overall health impact of drug use and the components of this impact, identify particularly risky patterns of use, and potentially identify new risks.\r

    dcterms:description """The survey was based on data collected within the scope of a wider investigation that feeds into one of the Commission’s top priorities: to create a borderless Digital Single Market (DSM) across Europe. The Commission’s DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase). The main objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the current state of play of cross-border e-commerce in the EU28 and 2) to identify the main drivers and barriers to the proper functioning of a DSM across the EU.  \r

The composition, age and deformational history of the rocks underlying the seabed (bedrock) are important for a range of stakeholders, including marine spatial planners and offshore developers. The dataset is arranged in two GIS layers: Bedrock Lithostratigraphy and Bedrock Structural Geology. The polygons within the Bedrock Lithostratigraphy layer show the spatial distribution of the principal lithostratigraphical units (formations and groups). The lines within the Structural Geology layer show the location and extent of known structural features such as faults and folds. This broadscale dataset was derived from geophysical data (e.g. airgun, boomer, sparker, sidescan sonar, magnetometer, gravity meter) and data obtained from commercial wells and BGS shallow boreholes.

The pandemic, the rapid transition from face-to-face to distance learning have further highlighted their essential contribution to our societies. If in one hand, teachers’ role is evolving as new demands and expectations arise, together with new responsibilities, on the other hand, this profession has been going through a vocational crisis for some years now. National and European policy-makers have been developing solutions to mitigate the impact of shortages and maintain high quality teaching standards. This report, focused on lower secondary teachers (ISCED 2), contributes to the debate by providing evidence on both policies and practices. It combines Eurydice data on national legislation with data on teachers’ practices and perceptions from the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS). These two data sources together shed light on the impact produced by national policies on teachers’ behaviours. It also provides ground for evidence-based reforms. The report covers all 27 EU Member States, as well as the United Kingdom, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey."@en ;

It is operated on a Dornier Do-228 aircraft from altitudes of 2000 to 6000 m above ground in X-band (3 cm wavelength) only, featuring four transmit (operated sequentially) and twelve parallel receive channels. Depending on antenna deployment, it is either fully polarimetric (HH,HV,VV,VH), inetrferomtric in along- and/or across-track mode, or can be operated as a digital beamforming SAR. It has full repeat-pass capabilities. Data are processed up to three different levels: RGI (Radar Geometry Image product), INF (Interferometric product) and GTC (Geocoded and Terrain-Corrected product). The data acquisition modes are selected based on the individually planned experiments.

The current version of the portal covers electricity. The second version to be released in June will also cover hydrogen and natural gas. A third version is being considered for late 2016 or 2017 to also cover biofuels and LPG.\r
\r
The Observatory is there to support the development of alternative transport fuels in Europe and assist the Member States with the implementation of Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of recharging and refuelling stations. This Directive requires that the Member States ensure a minimum coverage of certain alternative fuels by end 2020, or end 2025 or end 2030 depending on the fuels. The Observatory will also be of great use to cities as a pilot of 20 cities are developing a city-specific factsheet for the deployment of alternative transport fuels, which will be ready this summer. Interested cities are encouraged to contact the EAFO team.\r
\r
Up until now, data has been available on a fragmented and non-quality checked basis. The Observatory is gathering all existing data, performing the necessary quality checks and cross-checks so that users can trust their reliability. It also provides useful relevant information. Regular research and analysis will be conducted on the basis of the data and information, to provide recommendations to policy-makers and stakeholders. \r
\r
For many parts, the Observatory receives direct input from European countries and stakeholders. People and entities holding additional data and information are cordially invited to share it with the Observatory to the benefit of all. Only together will we be stronger and be able to support our European citizens and businesses.\r
\r
The Observatory is managed by a consortium led by AVERE, the European Association for Electromobility. Also involved are POLIS, a leading association of cities; the VUB, the Flemish University of Brussels; TNO, a consultancy; and Tobania, an IT company.\r

\r
The Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network (EaP-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation with the regional partners on a quarterly and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant to provide regular updates and identify emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports are aimed at offering support for strategic and operational decision making.\r
\r
Methodology\r
\r
The Eastern Partnership Quarterly statistical overview is focused on quarterly developments for the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs; (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs; (3) refusals of entry; (4) detections of illegal stay; (5) asylum applications; (6) detections of facilitators; and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.\r
\r
The backbone of this overview are monthly statistics provided within the framework of the EaP-RAN (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) and reference period statistics from common border sections of the neighbouring EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania). The data are processed, checked for errors and merged into an Excel database for further analysis.\r

The EBC was designed as a regular activity/forum where specific challenges related to irregular migration at the eastern borders of the EU could be addressed by representatives of FRAN (Frontex Risk Analysis Network) and the relevant neighbouring third countries. By 2009 Frontex had signed cooperation arrangements with Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Moldova and Belarus. Subsequently, Frontex proposed to set up a permanent Eastern Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN), to be comprised of the competent Border Control Authorities from the mentioned four countries and the Risk Analysis Unit of Frontex. Additional agreements were later signed allowing for the establishment of regular information exchange and joint analytical activities: with Moldova in March 2009 (Cooperation Plan), with Ukraine in November 2010 (Mechanism on information exchange for risk analysis cooperation) and with Belarus in November 2010 (Memorandum on regular exchange information and joint analytical activities). The Russian Federation opted to stay out of the EB-RAN information exchange."@en ;

    dcterms:description """The unprecedented migration crisis of recent years has mostly affected the Eastern and Central Mediterranean migratory routes to the EU. However, in 2015 and early 2016, a partial shift of the migration flow to the northernmost section of the EU’s eastern border was observed, when a few thousand migrants reached the EU / Schengen area on the so-called Northern (or Arctic) route. The situation at the eastern borders returned to normal later in 2016. In fact, most of the migration-related indicators showed a slight decline compared with 2015.\r
\r
For example, there was a decrease in the number of illegal border-crossings of Vietnamese migrants reported within the EaP-RAN. Nevertheless, the number of migrants crossing the border illegally from the Russian Federation to the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) remained relatively high. Most of the facilitators detected along the EU’s eastern border were Russians of Chechen origin.\r
\r
Importantly, a set of measures to curb migration flow implemented by the EaP RAN members both inland and at the common borders, as well as temporary reintroduction of border controls at the EU’s internal borders of Poland, led to a seasonal decrease in facilitated movements via the Baltic States and Poland.\r
\r
Moreover, intra-Schengen movements of Vietnamese via the Baltic States and Poland were still reported in 2016. In some cases Vietnamese irregular migrants were exposed to health hazards while hiding in vehicles.\r
\r
The number of Afghans and Syrians who crossed the border illegally from Ukraine also declined. The nationwide operation ‘Frontier-2016’ launched by the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine significantly contributed to this decrease, in particular measures implemented in Zakarpattia, the region of Ukraine frequently transited by migrants from both Afghanistan and Syria. On the other hand, there were more Indians, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans attempting to reach the EU via Ukraine.\r
\r
In terms of other new developments, many Turkish citizens (mainly of Kurdish origin) were detected using false Schengen visas or attempting to cross the border illegally from Ukraine intending to ultimately reach Germany.\r
\r
With regard to illegal border-crossings by nationals from the countries of the region and / or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a drop of 20% was recorded. Most of them were detected at the borders of Ukraine.\r
\r
In contrast to the relatively low number of reported illegal border-crossings, the number of people refused entry to the EU at its eastern land borders exceeded 118 000 compared with just 61 590 in 2015. The vast majority of refusals of entry (96%) was issued to regional nationalities. Russians prevailed with an over fourfold increase in refusals of entry compared with 2015.\r
\r
In addition to the Russian citizens, the number of refusals of entry issued to Tajiks doubled. This increase was matched by a similar rise in asylum applications of Tajiks at the EU level. Among the EU Member States, the vast majority of refusals was issued by Poland, while the highest number of citizens of Tajikistan submitted their asylum requests in Germany.\r
\r
Finally, data collected within the Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network (EaP-RAN), as well as the results of Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations, indicate that tobacco products remained the excise goods that were most frequently smuggled across the EU’s eastern borders towards the EU.\r
\r
The year 2016 was marked by an increased number of detections of contraband tobacco hidden in cargo trains, a growing number of cases where flying objects were used to smuggle goods across the border, as well as more minors detected while smuggling cigarettes between BCPs.\r
\r
As regards illicit drugs, hashish and synthetic drugs were mostly trafficked out of the EU, whereas heroin and cocaine were smuggled into the EU, which was either the destination or a transit area towards the Russian market.\r
\r
In conclusion, the migratory crisis in the EU had very limited impact on the irregular migratory movements within the EaP countries or en route towards neighbouring EU Member States. This is not likely to change significantly in the future provided that the current operational response by all the countries in the region is maintained."""@en ;

    dcterms:description "Frontex created in August of 2008 a concept of Eastern Borders Conference (EBC).The EBC was designed as a regular activity/forum where specific challenges related to irregular migration at the eastern borders of the EU could be addressed by FRAN (Frontex Risk Analysis Network) representatives and the relevant neighbouring third countries. By 2009 Frontex signed Working Arrangements (WA) with Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Moldova and Belarus. Subsequently, Frontex proposed to set up a permanent Eastern Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN), to be comprised of the competent Border Control Authorities from the mentioned four countries and the Risk Analysis Unit of Frontex. Additional agreements were later signed allowing for the establishment of regular information exchange and joint analytical activities: with Moldova in March 2009 (Cooperation Plan), with Ukraine in November 2010 (Mechanism on information exchange for risk analysis cooperation) and with Belarus in November 2010 (Memorandum on regular exchange of information and joint analytical activities). When proposing to set up EB RAN, Frontex also proposed to draft a joint risk analysis each year, based in part on monthly statistical information exchange. However, the monthly statistical data exchange between Frontex and the EB-RAN countries had not yet been fully established at the time. This in turn made drafting of a joint annual analysis impossible. Nevertheless, an Annual Overview covering 2009 was delivered by Frontex in November 2010. By 4 June 2011, Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine provided monthly statistical data for 2010. As this data still have not provided enough information for a joint annual analysis, the following document is to be considered as the second EB-RAN Annual Overview."@en ;

    dcterms:description """Harmonised competitiveness indicators (HCIs) are based on consumer price indices, on gross domestic product (GDP) deflators and on unit labour cost indices for the total economy (period averages; index: Q1 1999=100).  

The consumer price indices measure the average change over time in the prices paid by households for a specific basket of consumer goods and services. 

GDP is a measure of economic activity. It is the value of an economy's total output of goods and services,  plus net taxes on products and imports and minus intermediate consumption. The GDP deflators are derived from quarterly national accounts as published by Eurostat (period averages; index Q1 1999=100). 

Unit labour costs for the total economy are calculated as the ratio of compensation per employee to labour productivity. Labour productivity is measured as GDP at constant prices divided by the total number of persons employed using quarterly national accounts as published by Eurostat (period averages; index: Q1 1999=100).

The purpose of HCIs is to provide comparable measures of euro area countries' price and cost competitiveness that are also consistent with the real effective exchange rates (EERs) of the euro. The HCIs are constructed using the same methodology and data sources that are used for the euro EERs."""@en ;

Government debt-to-GDP ratio refers to the Maastricht criteria. The government debt statistics used are those used in the context of the excessive deficit procedure. (Financial stocks at nominal value, percentage points, not seasonally or working day adjusted). The last two years presented in the graphs are based on European Commission forecasts (Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs). The reference value set by the Maastricht criteria is 60%. 

Government deficit-to-GDP ratio refers to the Maastricht criteria. The government deficit statistics include settlements under swaps (non-financial flows, current prices, percentage points, not seasonally or working day adjusted). The last two years presented in the graphs are based on European Commission forecasts (Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs). The reference value for the budget deficit under the Stability and Growth Pact is 3%. 


Households' debt-to-gross disposable income ratio. Gross disposable income is adjusted for the change in net equity of households in pension fund reserves (non-consolidated, current prices, percentage points, not seasonally or working day adjusted).

Non-financial corporations' debt-to-gross domestic product ratio. The statistics are taken from the national accounts statistics. Debt includes pension reserve liabilities and excludes financial derivatives owing to a lack of comparability across countries (non-consolidated, market prices, percentage points, not seasonally or working day adjusted)."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The "EMODnet Digital Bathymetry (DTM)" is a multilayer bathymetric product for Europe’s sea basins covering::\r
• the Greater North Sea, including the Kattegat and stretches of water such as Fair Isle, Cromarty, Forth, Forties, Dover, Wight, and Portland\r
• the English Channel and Celtic Seas\r
• Western and Central Mediterranean Sea and Ionian Sea\r
• Bay of Biscay, Iberian coast and North-East Atlantic\r
• Adriatic Sea\r
• Aegean - Levantine Sea (Eastern Mediterranean)\r
• Azores - Madeira EEZ\r
• Canary Islands\r
• Baltic Sea\r
• Black Sea\r
• Norwegian – Icelandic seas\r
\r
The DTM is based upon more than 7700 bathymetric survey data sets and Composite DTMs that have been gathered from 27 data providers from 18 European countries and involving 169 data originators. The gathered survey data sets can be discovered and requested for access through the Common Data Index (CDI) data discovery and access service that also contains additional European survey data sets for global waters. The Composite DTMs can be discovered through the Sextant Catalogue service. Both discovery services make use of SeaDataNet standards and services and have been integrated in the EMODnet Bathymetry web portal (http://www.emodnet-bathymetry.eu). In addition, the Bathymetry Viewing and Download service of the EMODnet bathymetry portal gives users wide functionality for viewing and downloading the EMODnet digital bathymetry such as:\r
• water depth (refering to the Lowest Astronomical Tide Datum - LAT) in gridded form \r
on a DTM grid of 1/8 * 1/8 arc minute of longitude and latitude (ca 230 * 230 meters)\r
• option to view depth parameters of individual DTM cells and references to source data\r
• option to download DTM in 16 tiles in different formats: ESRI ASCII, XYZ, EMODnet CSV, NetCDF (CF), GeoTiff and SD\r
• layer with a number of high resolution DTMs for coastal regions\r
• layer with wrecks from the UKHO Wrecks database.\r
The NetCDF (CF) DTM files are fit for use in a special 3D Viewer software package which is based on the existing open source NASA World Wind JSK application. It has been developed in the frame of the EU FP7 Geo-Seas project (another sibling of SeaDataNet for marine geological and geophysical data) and is freely available. The 3D viewer also supports the ingestion of WMS overlay maps. The SD files can also be used for 3D viewing by means of the freely available iView4De(Fledermaus) software.\r
\r
The original datasets themselves are not distributed but described in the metadata services, giving clear information about the background survey data used for the DTM, their access restrictions, originators and distributors and facilitating requests by users to originator."""@en ;

The 2008 crisis has tended to widen disparities in employment rates and in 2013, rates were 11 percentage points higher in more developed regions than in less developed ones (72% and 61%). Under the Europe 2020 strategy, Member States have set national targets for the employment rate which are broadly consistent with the 75% overall target being achieved by 2020. These vary from 62.9% in Malta to 80% in Denmark and Sweden.

It is updated regularly as it projects the impact of current EU policies on energy and transport trends as well as changes in the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\r
\r
It provides projections for indicators, such as the share of renewable energy sources or levels of energy efficiency, on a five-year period up until 2050 for the EU as a whole and for each EU country.\r
\r
The Reference Scenario is a projection of where our current set of policies coupled with market trends are likely to lead. The EU has set ambitious objectives for 2020, 2030 and 2050 on climate and energy, so the Reference Scenario allows policy makers to analyse the long-term economic, energy, climate and transport outlook based on the current policy framework.\r
\r
The Reference Scenario is not designed as a forecast of what is likely to happen in the future. It rather provides a benchmark against which new policy proposals can be assessed.\r
\r
With the active participation of national experts from all EU countries, the European Commission works in partnership with a modelling consortium led by the National Technical University of Athens to develop the Reference Scenario.\r

 \r
This dataset contains railway accident investigations. Articles 19-25 of the Safety Directive outline the requirements for the investigation and reporting of accidents and incidents on the railway. Member States are required to notify ERA of accident investigations and to submit copies of the accident investigation report when complete. The responsibility for this activity lies with an Independent Investigation body within each of the Member States. The reports received are published by ERA.\r
 \r
Some investigation bodies investigate and chose to report to ERA a much wider range of incidents and accidents than those required by the Safety Directive with a view to sharing lessons learned from accidents at a European level. ERA encourages such reporting.\r
 \r
Consequently the following reports are not intended for statistical use but for information on the causal factors in accidents and on the recommendations issued to the National Safety Authorities.\r
 \r
Common approaches to the investigation and reporting of accidents are facilitated through the Network of National Investigation Bodies. Information on the activities of this Network can be found on the ERA web pages.\r

    dcterms:description """EU-OSHA’s European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) is an extensive survey looking at how safety and health risks are managed in European workplaces. \r
\r
The first ESENER, carried out in 2009, involved nearly 36,000 interviews with managers and OSH representatives. All EU Member States were covered, as were Turkey, Norway and Switzerland — 31 countries in all. The interviewees worked in private and public sector organisations with 10 or more employees.\r
\r
Representatives of thousands of businesses and organisations across Europe respond to ESENER questionnaires, which focus particularly on:\r
\r
•General OSH risks and how they are managed \r
\r
 •Psychosocial risks such as stress, bullying and harassment \r
\r
 •Drivers of and barriers to action in OSH management \r
\r
 •Worker participation in OSH\r
\r
\r
The focus on new and emerging risks means that the responses shed light on underexplored and increasingly important areas of OSH, such as psychosocial risks, which are a growing area of concern in European workplaces. \r
\r
 ESENER provides much-needed data to policy-makers and researchers at national and European level. There is no other EU-level information source on how OSH is managed in businesses. ESENER plays a key role in helping EU-OSHA to provide cross-nationally comparable information that can contribute to OSH policy-making."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """EU-OSHA’s European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) is an extensive survey that looks at how European workplaces manage safety and health risks in practice.\r
\r
Thousands of businesses and organisations across Europe are asked to respond to a questionnaire that focuses on:\r
\r
•General safety and health risks in the workplace and how they are managed\r
•Psychosocial risks, such as stress, bullying and harassment\r
•Drivers of and barriers to OSH management\r
•Worker participation in safety and health practices.\r
\r
The results from these interviews are complemented by secondary analyses involving a series of in-depth studies that focus on specific topics. Quantitative and qualitative research methodologies are applied in these studies to help better understand the main findings from the survey.\r
\r
The fieldwork for the second wave of ESENER was carried out in the summer-autumn of 2014. The survey provides an invaluable up-to-date snapshot of how workplace risks, and especially new and emerging risks, are being managed across Europe. \r
\r
The focus on new and emerging risks means that the responses shed light on underexplored and increasingly important areas of OSH, such as psychosocial risks, which are a growing area of concern in European workplaces. \r
\r
The 2014 survey is even more detailed and extensive than the first one, with the sample sizes increased by half, and in three countries the national samples have been additionally boosted. ESENER-2 includes micro enterprises of 5 to 10 employees and agricultural businesses for the first time. Five new countries — Albania, Iceland, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia — have been added to the 31 that were included in 2009.\r
\r
Some of the topics covered are:\r
•Musculoskeletal disorders\r
•The organisation of OSH management\r
•Approaches to worker participation in OSH\r
\r
ESENER provides much-needed data to policy-makers and researchers at national and European level. There is no other EU-level information source on how OSH is managed in businesses. ESENER plays a key role in helping EU-OSHA to provide cross-nationally comparable information that can contribute to OSH policy-making. \r

    dcterms:description """The European Commission has published country factsheets outlining the progress of individual Member States in meeting their agreed targets under the Europe 2020 Strategy. The factsheets give the state of play in various themes under the three headline targets of the Strategy: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. They place each country in a European perspective by measuring performance and comparing to the EU average, as well as the best and the worst performers in the Union.\r
\r
Each fact sheet shows the country's national target, the EU target and the highest and lowest targets adopted by other countries. In addition, it measures how far that country is from the target it has set itself and compares this to the EU and the most and least ambitious country. \r
\r
These factsheets are based primarily on data from Eurostat, but also from the Joint Research Centre, the European Environmental Agency, the World Bank and other sources. The targets have been collected from official documents. In some cases, absolute targets have been translated into relative targets to allow for a cross country comparison."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Eurofound’s COVID-19 EU PolicyWatch collates information on the responses of government and social partners to the crisis, as well as gathering examples of company practices aimed at mitigating the social and economic impacts. \r
\r
The database includes large-scale government measures and wider collective agreements, as well as regional and local initiatives and support measures for smaller groups of workers. As the situation is evolving, measures are newly implemented, changed or cancelled and replaced at rapid speed.\r
\r
In the current updating round, the database focuses on the following areas in the context of COVID-19: involvement of social partners in legislation and other statutory regulations; collective agreements; social partner initiatives; company practices. \r
\r
Outside the scope of this database are public health measures, travel and movement restrictions and company-specific job losses, the latter of which are reported in Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) events database. The ERM database on support instruments for restructuring also provides more structural information on some types of measures, as well as offering the option to filter by measures taken in response to COVID-19. More in-depth sector-specific guidance for adapting workplaces can be obtained from EU-OSHA.  \r

Our latest analysis tells us that there are an estimated 3600 organised crime groups currently active in the EU. They show a tendency to be more international in nature and activity which creates an even greater need for international cooperation in fighting crime.\r

The Recommendation was adopted to address the difficult situation in the EU banking system, especially with regard to the sovereign exposures. It called on National Authorities to require banks included in the sample to strengthen their capital positions by building up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market prices as at the end of September 2011. In addition, banks were required to establish an exceptional and temporary buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches a level of 9% by the end of June 2012."@en ;

The processing chain comprises geometric correction, radiometric correction and pixel identification, LAI calculation with the BEAM MERIS vegetation processor, re-projection to a global grid, and temporal aggregation selecting the measurement closest to the mean value. After the LAI pre-processing we applied time series analysis to fill data gaps and filter outliers using the technique of harmonic analysis in combination with mean annual and multiannual phenological data. Data gaps are caused by clouds, sensor limitations due to the solar zenith angle (less than 10 degrees), topography and intermittent data reception. We applied our technique for the whole period of observation (Jul 2002 - Mar 2012). Validation, was performed using VALERI and BigFoot data."@en ;

    dcterms:description "In 2011 the British Geological Survey (BGS) decided to begin the assembly of a National Geological Model (NGM) from its existing and on-going geological framework models , comprising integrated national crustal, bedrock and Quaternary models. The bedrock component is the most advanced of these themes and comprises both the calculated models and a complementary network of cross-sections that provide a fence diagram for the bedrock geology of Great Britain. This fence diagram, the GB3D_v2014 dataset is available in a variety of formats from the BGS website www.bgs.ac.uk as free downloads, it supercedes the earlier 2012 version. The model complements the existing 1:625 000 scale mapsheets published by BGS utilising the same colour schema and geological classification. The component cross-sections extend to depths between 1.5 and 6 km; they have an aggregate length of over 25,000 km, and they are snapped together at their intersections to ensure total consistency. The sections are based on the existing BGS geological framework models where they cut through them together and incorporate around 300 deep stratigraphic boreholes across England and Wales. The sections also take account of the vast wealth of published data on the subsurface structure of Britain both from BGS and in the scientific literature. Much of this is in the form of cross-sections, contour maps of surfaces, and thicknesses (isopachs). The fence diagram has been built in the Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3D (GSI3D) software. It is envisaged that this dataset will form a useful educational resource for geoscience students and the general public, and also provide the bedrock geology context and structure for regional and catchment scale studies. The fence diagram has been built in stages between 2009-14 using funding from the BGS National Capability Programme the Environment Agency of England and Wales, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Some 16 expert regional geologists compiled the sections."@en ;

    dcterms:description """Since its launch in 1990, Eurofound's European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) has provided an overview of working conditions in Europe. It aims to create a comprehensive picture of the everyday reality of men and women at work. \r
\r
Themes covered include employment status, working time duration and organisation, work organisation, learning and training, physical and psychosocial risk factors, health and safety, work-life balance, worker participation, earnings and financial security, as well as work and health. For the fifth EWCS in 2010 workers were surveyed in the then EU27, Norway, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. \r
\r
The data explorer (survey mapping tool) offers a graphical presentation of the findings of the fifth EWCS. \r
\r
The tables presented here complement the data in the survey mapping tool. The variables in the tables are sorted by topic, and proportions, mean values or distributions are given for different subcategories of respondents. Column A of the tables states the original name of each variable in the survey, with a label that specifies the content of the variable. Column B specifies the different answer categories for that variable. \r
\r
For some variables, the answer categories have been condensed into fewer categories in order to reduce the table’s size or in order to show the distribution of a numerical variable. The original wording and coding of the questions can be viewed on the EWCS 2010 questionnaire.\r

    dcterms:description """In the fourth quarter of 2017, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing (IBC) between Border Crossing Points at the EU’s external border was at the lowest level for a fourth quarter since 2013, and at the second-lowest level for any quarter since the EU-Turkey Statement entered into force. The 39% fall compared to Q4 2016, reflects in particular strong decreases on the Central Mediterranean and the Western Balkan routes, against which stood strong relative increases on the Western Mediterranean sea route and on the Eastern Mediterranean route.\r
\r
On account of intensified activities of the Libyan Coast Guard the Central Mediterranean route registered a strong relative decrease compared to Q4 2016 (-72%) and the lowest quarterly aggregate number of illegal border-crossings since Q1 2015. The sudden uptick in launches from Tunisia (almost exclusively Tunisians), recorded already in Q3 2017, continued in Q4 2017 (3 770).\r

On the Eastern Mediterranean route, despite the season, the flow stayed at a high level, in fact the second-highest quarterly total since the implementation of the EU‑Turkey Statement was recorded, despite the commitment exhibited by the Turkish side to border control. In particular, the large share of Syrians observed in Q3 2017 continued. Meanwhile, at the land border the strong influx of Turkish migrants continued (making up 44% of the flow).\r
\r
On the Western Mediterranean Sea route, yet another record number of detections was recorded, with a quarter that exceeded the annual total of any year in FRAN historical data before 2016. This record high occurred notwithstanding intense patrolling activities and preventions of departure by Moroccan and Algerian maritime assets. Of the 9 444 detections on both the sea and land route, 8 662 (92%) claimed to be minors. The mostly male minors from Algeria and Morocco in debriefings professed to have been sent by their families to earn a living in Europe. In contrast, on the Western Mediterranean land route, the number of illegal border crossings fell to a record low of a mere 47 detections.\r
\r
On the Western Balkan route, a new subroute from Greece via Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Croatia, has been emerging.\r
\r
As regards other FRAN indicators and again in comparison to Q4 2016, the fall of the numbers of return decisions, effective returns as well as asylum applications coincides with the fall in illegal border crossings. Even though there are gaps in the data reported by Member States for clandestine entry, the decline in the numbers reported for this indicator may well be due to the difficulty to detect clandestine entries. Finally it is worth noting that detected illegal stays on exit saw moderate increases."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The Gender Equality Index is a composite indicator that measures the complex concept of gender equality and, based on the EU policy framework, assists in monitoring progress of gender equality across the EU over time.\r
\r
The Gender Equality Index supports the development and implementation of evidence-based gender equality policies and legislation and shows the different outcomes of those policies for women and men. It also increases awareness of progress and challenges in implementing gender equality policies among decision-makers and the general public. Finally, the Index highlights data gaps and calls for harmonised, comparable and reliable data that are both disaggregated by sex and available for all Member States.\r
\r
The Gender Equality Index consists of eight domains. The six domains work, money, knowledge, time, power, health which are combined into a core Index that is complemented by two additional, equally important, satellite domains of violence and intersecting inequalities. They belong to the framework of the Gender Equality Index in all respects, but do not impact the overall score. Each domain is further divided into sub-domains which cover the key issues within the respective thematic areas. The full conceptual framework is presented in the first edition of the Index.<br />\r
\r
Using this framework, 31 indicators have been chosen to monitor developments in gender equality in the six core domains in every Member State as well as the EU-28 in total. The Gender Equality Index is formed by combining these indicators into a single summary measure, which allows for the complex issue of gender equality to be synthesised into one easy to understand measure."""@en ;

Until the crisis in 2008, disparities between regional economies in the EU were shrinking. In 2000, average GDP per head in the most developed 20% of regions was about 3.5 higher than that in the least developed 20%. By 2008, the difference had narrowed to 2.8 times. This was mainly due to the regions with the lowest GDP per head growing faster than average and catching up with the more prosperous  ones (a process known as Beta convergence). However, the crisis seems to have brought this tendency to an end and between 2008 and 2011, regional disparities widened (the coefficient of variation increased slightly).

Launched in 2003 by the European Commission, the programme is part of a broad push to create an energy-intelligent future for us all. It supports EU energy efficiency and renewable energy policies, with a view to reaching the EU 2020 targets (20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, 20% improvement in energy efficiency and 20% of renewables in EU energy consumption).\r
\r
The programme is a pillar of the EU's Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP).\r
\r
More than 600 projects across Europe have been co-funded by programme since 2003. These projects cover fields as diverse as education and electrical appliances, yet all contribute to building a greener and more secure energy future for the EU. You can find the list of beneficiaries and projects funded by the programme."""@en ;

Since the start of the COVID19 crisis, the Commission, the Member States and the shipping industry have been taking measures to ensure the continuity of operations and thus the security of supply. \r
\r
The situation is evolving day by day and the effects could be long-term. What shipping will look like post COVID-19 is unclear, however EMSA has the necessary data and tools to analyse the impact of the pandemic on certain shipping activities by analysing vessel traffic data and providing reliable figures to assist in the definition of the recovery policies and specific measures. These figures should assist all parties involved (EU, maritime administrations and shipping industry) in determining a recovery strategy to overcome the economic crisis that Europe is facing.\r
\r
The objective of this report is to provide figures on the impact of COVID-19 on shipping traffic; it is based on solid vessel movements statistics showing the port call trends without interpreting the statistical data. The report could not serve the purpose of an economic impact analysis since the trade volumes are not available in the EMSA systems. The report focuses mainly on EU ports and EU flagged ships, but there are also statistics about the shipping routes from Europe to China and from Europe to the US have been affected.\r

The report is updated on a weekly basis and will be published every Friday."""@en ;

Following independence in 1991, Georgia faced a series of political crises that devastated the economy and had a dramatic impact on migration patterns. Post-independence migration has been marked by three significant stages, each closely linked with political and economic developments. In 2011, Georgia’s employment and unemployment rates were 55.4% and 15.1% respectively. Under these difficult conditions of high unemployment and underemployment, international migration offers an outlet for Georgians and fulfils an essential role in the Georgian economy. It is estimated that the migrant stock abroad is over one million people (25% of the Georgian population) and that temporary migration flows annually involve between 6% and 10% of the population.\r

This Convention applies to most fishery resources of the Northwest Atlantic except salmon, tunas/marlins, whales, and sedentary species (e.g. shellfish). In 2009, NAFO has 12 Members from North America, Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. The Commission has entrusted the EFCA to coordinate the EU control and inspections activities in this area through a Joint Deployment Plan. \r
\r
The NAFO JDP gives effect to the control and enforcement measures to ensure conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources managed by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). The Joint Deployment Plan pools resources (inspectors and patrol vessels), from ten EU Member States and use them to ensure more effective and uniform control of fishing activities in the Northwest Atlantic. These Member States are Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.\r

    dcterms:description """<br>The Digital Public Administration Factsheets provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent digital government developments in 37 European countries and in the European Union. They are published as part of the National Interoperability Framework Observatory (NIFO) project and constitute a vital step in the process of monitoring the development in Digital Public Administration in Europe.  </br>  \r
<br>The goal of these factsheets is to become a prime source of country intelligence on all digital public administration-related matters in Europe, while capturing useful information on the main trends and developments in this field. At the same time, the factsheets provide information on European countries’ main actors and institutions responsible for the maintenance and delivery of Digital Public Administration services.  </br>  \r
<br>To provide a detailed picture on the state of Digital Public Administration development in Europe, the Digital Public Administration factsheets are updated through a comprehensive research process which involves the following phases: 1) A qualitative review of the information already available in the factsheets, an update of the key document information (e.g. individuals responsible) and thorough desk research on the latest developments in digital public administration; 2) The Word file of the factsheets is then directly distributed to the different national contact points (NCPs) for their contribution; 3) A content and consistency check is performed after receiving contribution from the NCPs; 4) A final quality assurance check for the style and language of the document is performed by a professional editor; 5) A final validation process involving the national representative is conducted.  </br>  \r
<br>This year's factsheets are shorter, less repetitive and more user-friendly compared to previous editions. Through the new look and feel they are also revamped and more visual. Lastly, there is a strong emphasis on the European Interoperability Framework implementation, with a dedicated section in Chapter 1.  </br>  """@en ;

The EFCA coordinates the implementation of EU obligations as a NEAFC contracting party, defined in the NEAFC convention and the NEAFC scheme of control and enforcement (NEAFC scheme).   \r
\r
The NEAFC JDP has been operating since 2009 with the participation of Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which collaborate in the implementation of NEAFC rules through the system of joint sea campaigns.   \r
\r
Joint sea campaigns are planned, implemented and assessed each year in close cooperation between the European Commission, the Member State concerned and the EFCA to ensure achievement of the compliance with the conservation and control measures in force.   \r
\r
The EFCA has also been delegated by the Commission to fulfil a number of tasks related to the notification to the NEAFC the list of EU inspectors and inspection means and compiling annual reports on EU inspection activities in the NEAFC RA. The EFCA also sends all the originals of inspection reports carried out by Member State inspectors in the NEAFC RA to fishing vessel flag states with copies of inspection reports being sent to the European Commission and the NEAFC secretariat.\r

Concerns about lack of transparency in the EU administration accounted for the biggest proportion of the cases. The year also saw the Ombudsman open strategic inquiries and initiatives into key issues, such as how the Commission carries out conflict of interest assessments for its Special Advisers and how the Commission handles Commissioners’ post-mandate jobs. The first European Ombudsman Award for Good Administration was launched (attracting 90 nominations) and the first European Network of Ombudsmen conference in Brussels focused on Ombudsmen cooperation in the areas of migration, lobbying transparency and the rule of law."@en ;

The CoR may also issue an opinion on its own initiative on the legislative projects of which its members believe they are of significant importance for the Regional and Local Authorities. The dossier is allocated to the relevant internal commission and a Member of the CoR is appointed as rapporteur. The rapporteur consults stakeholders, drafts the opinion, and presents it for discussion, amendment and adoption by the Members of the commission. After being adopted by the CoR commission, the draft opinion is discussed at the plenary session. Once it has been adopted by vote, the opinion is sent to all the European institutions and published in the Official Journal of the European Union. An inter-institutional follow-up is ensured."@en ;
