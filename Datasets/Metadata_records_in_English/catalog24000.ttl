    dcterms:description """This global accessibility map enumerates land-based travel time to the nearest densely-populated area for all areas between 85 degrees north and 60 degrees south for a nominal year 2015.

Densely-populated areas are defined as contiguous areas with 1,500 or more inhabitants per square kilometer or a majority of built-up land cover types coincident with a population centre of at least 50,000 inhabitants.

This map was produced through a collaboration between the University of Oxford Malaria Atlas Project (MAP), Google, the European Union Joint Research Centre (JRC), and the University of Twente, Netherlands. The underlying datasets used to produce the map, include roads (comprising the first ever global-scale use of Open Street Map and Google roads datasets), railways, rivers, lakes, oceans, topographic conditions (slope and elevation), landcover types, and national borders.

These datasets were each allocated a speed or speeds of travel in terms of time to cross each pixel of that type. The datasets were then combined to produce a “friction surface”, a map where every pixel is allocated a nominal overall speed of travel based on the types occurring within that pixel. Least-cost-path algorithms (running in Google Earth Engine and, for high-latitude areas, in R) were used in conjunction with this friction surface to calculate the time of travel from all locations to the nearest city (by travel time). Cities were determined using the high-density-cover product created by the Global Human Settlement Project.

Each pixel in the resultant accessibility map thus represents the modeled shortest time from that location to a city.

The MAJA product offers an alternative to the official ESA L2A product and has been processed with consideration of the characteristics of the Sentinel-2 mission (fast collection of time series, constant sensor perspective, and global coverage). Assumptions about the temporal constancy of the ground cover are taken into account for a robust detection of clouds and a more flexible determination of aerosol properties.

    dcterms:description """This dataset is an output of the “Mediterranean Sensitive Habitats” project (MEDISEH). It shows under a raster form modelled spatial distributions of Posidonia oceanica across the Mediterranean Sea. Posidonia oceanica is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, where it is the dominant seagrass, covering about 50,000 km2 of coastal to offshore sandy and rocky areas down to depths of about 45 m. P. oceanica is a protected species according to EU legislation (Habitat directive), the Bern and Barcelona Conventions and several national legislations. While its distribution is well documented along the European shores of the western Mediterranean Sea, limited information is available about the southern shore and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In order to bridge this information gap, one of the goals of Task 1.3 of the MEDISEH project was to model P. oceanica distribution across the whole Mediterranean basin.
A Random Forest (i.e. a Machine Learning technique) was “trained” on data from regions where information was available and then used to predict the probability of occurrence of P. oceanica where needed. 
The raster has a spatial resolution of 0.004166 decimal degrees, and the values are in the [0,1] interval (occurrence probabilities)."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The Weser estuary at the German North Sea coast serves as a fairway to the harbours of Bremerhaven and Bremen. To ensure safe shipping and navigation, the navigation channel depths are nowadays intensively monitored, and have been so in the past. These are valuable data for consulting and research purposes, and enables investigations leading to a better understanding of hydrodynamics, salt intrusion and morphological processes in the estuary, in the present as well as the past.
For recent years, thanks to modern monitoring techniques and digitalization, measuring data has been compiled to consistent digital terrain models of high quality and accuracy. For time periods before the 1990ies however, measurements were scarcer and the data are available only in form of printed bathymetrical and nautical charts.

The objective of the project “Historical system states of the Weser estuary (HIWEST)” was to:
• digitalize depths measurements starting from 1960, 
• georeference the data points and
• process and compile them to digital terrain models that can be used for research and consulting.

The project was led and financed by the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW). It was supported by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) and by the German Water and Shipping Administration (WSV) who provided printed charts and scanned data sets. The smile consulting GmbH was contracted to process the data and compile digital terrain models.

One of the main challenges of the project was georeferencing. While georeferencing and projecting in the horizontal domain was comparatively straightforward, the transformation of depths below different chart datums to the Germans mean height reference system represented a challenge. This was accomplished by an algorithm considering spatial polygons provided by BSH and further meta information on the different levelling systems.

The accuracy of the data sets differs depending on the quality of the original data. Since the 1990ies, powerful measurement methods such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and multibeam echo-sounding has led to high resolutions and high data accuracy. In past surveys, the depths were measured in single-beam echo-soundings, often along individual cross sections, and there is no information between these soundings. As a result, the older terrain models are much smoother then the newer ones and contain less detailed information. More technical details can be found in the appendix of the technical report.

The following digital terrain models (DTM, in the following the German abbreviation DGM is used) of the Lower and Outer Weser estuary were made available:
• DGM 1966, marking the situation before deepening the Outer Weser to SKN-12 m</li>
• DGM 1972, marking the situation before deepening the Lower Weser to SKN-9 m</li>
• DGM 1981, marking the situation before extensive river works in the Lower Weser</li>
• DGM 1996, marking the situation before deepening the Outer Weser to SKN-14 m</li>
• DGM 2002, marking the situation after deepening the Outer Weser to SKN-14 m, reference digital terrain model.

The years were chosen so they would represent consistent periods not affected by constructive engineering measures such as channel deepenings, and secondly based on optimal data availability. Each data set however consists not only of data from the respective year, but data had to be added from adjacent years. To close gaps, data from recent surveys were used. The data sets span the whole estuary from the North Sea to the tidal weir in the city of Bremen and are available as 1x1 m raster data sets.

Built-up areas are characterized by the substitution of the original (semi-) natural land cover or water surface with an artificial, often impervious cover. These artificial surfaces are usually maintained over long periods of time. A series of high resolution imperviousness datasets (for the 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 reference years) with all artificially sealed areas was produced using automatic derivation based on calibrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This series of imperviousness layers constitutes the main status layers. They are per-pixel estimates of impermeable cover of soil (soil sealing) and are mapped as the degree of imperviousness (0-100%). Imperviousness change layers were produced as a difference between the reference years (2006-2009, 2009-2012, 2012-2015 and additionally 2006-2012, to fully match the CORINE Land Cover production cycle) and are presented 1) as degree of imperviousness change (-100% -- +100%), in 20m and 100m pixel size, and 2) a classified (categorical) 20m change product.

The production of the High Resolution Imperviousness products was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.

The extension of the spatial coverage of the product includes the entire spatial coverage of Meteosat 0 degrees.  
The product is generated at the 15-min imaging rate of SEVIRI.
The spatial resolution  is consistent with the SEVIRI pixel, and changes across the Full Disk from 3 km near the sub-satellite point to 8 km on average over Europe. 
The H03B (P-IN-GRU-SEVIRI) precipitation estimates are obtained by combining IR GEO equivalent blackbody temperatures (TBB) at 10.8 μm (Channel 9) with rain rates from PMW measurements derived from SSMIS (utilized by P-IN-OBA-SSMIS new rel.) and AMSU-A and MHS (utilized by P-IN-ONN_AMSU). The algorithm is based on an underlying collection of time and space overlapping overpasses from GEO IR imagers and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) PMW sensors, which constitutes a look up table of geolocated relationships rain rate vs TBB, updated as soon as new overlapping GEO IR and LEO PMW overpasses are available.

    dcterms:description """This Ocean Colour product represents the algal pigment (Chlorophyll a) concentration in clear open waters, and it is defined by the 'OC4Me' Maximum Band Ratio (MBR) semi-analytical algorithm.
The product is derived from S3 OLCI L2 NRT water-leaving reflectances (calculated from the Baseline Atmospheric Correction).
A maximum band ratio approach is used for reflectances at 443, 490 and 510 nm, over that 560 nm (O3 to O6). 
It is expressed  in Units of mg/m3 as: log10 [Chl]= ∑4 x=0 =(Ax * (log10(Rij))x) which is the ratio of reflectance of band i, among 443, 490 and 510 nm, over that of band j at 560 nm. 
The following flags were applied: INVALID, LAND, CLOUD, CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS, CLOUD_MARGIN, SNOW_ICE, SUSPECT, HISOLZEN, SATURATED, HIGHGLINT, WHITECAPS, AC_FAIL, OC4ME_FAIL, ANNOT_TAU06. 
Full details of the chl_oc4me algorithm can be found in the case 1 resource link.
The image is an incrementally accumulated product of all the orbits over an entire day from both Sentinel-3A and -3B. 
Sentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme.

    dcterms:description """Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is the kinetic temperature of a water body at a defined depth. Although SLSTR measures an infrared radiometric temperature, it is provided as a kinetic temperature by considering the emissivity of the water body as part of the SST retrieval process. It is important to note that the SLSTR instruments return SST measurements for the ocean 'skin'. Due to the limited penetration of thermal infra-red radiation through the water column, this corresponds to the temperature in the top few tens of micrometres. 
At night, the skin temperature is typically a few tenths of a degree cooler than the temperature measured by in situ systems; in the day, the skin can be considerably higher if strong diurnal warming is present. For more details please see 'What is SST?' on the GHRSST web pages.
The SST measurement is obtained by means of a highly accurate calibration of the three infra-red channels at 3.74, 10.85 and 12 µm (S7-S8-S9). Corrections for water vapour atmospheric absorption are performed using a triple window at night, and a split window during the day as the 3.7 µm channel is not used due to solar contamination. 
Each on-ground pixel is viewed twice, via nadir and oblique views with different atmospheric path lengths, allowing for correction for aerosol effects. Consequently, there are four possible retrieved SSTs, referred to as N2 (nadir-only 11 µm and 12 µm), N3 (nadir-only 3.7 µm, 11 µm and 12 µm), D2 (dual-view 11 µm and 12 µm) and D3 (dual-view 3.7 µm, 11 µm and 12 µm). A fifth retrieval algorithm, N3R is similar to N3, but uses the property of'“aerosol robustness”, which is applicable in areas of high atmospheric aerosol content, e.g. near volcanoes.
The product is derived from SLSTR L2 NRT data. Following derivation was applied to select the SST pixels to be plotted from WST file: 
- if the observation is in the nadir-only / single-view part of swath (i.e. "sst_algorithm_types" is N2, N3, N3R) then SST = sea_surface_temperature
- If the observation is in the dual-view part of swath ((i.e. "sst_algorithm_types" is D2 or D3) then SST = sea_surface_temperature - dual_nadir_sst_difference.
Besides, the following flags were used to select which pixels to represent and display: (quality_level >=3)  and  (l2p_flags.land == 0) and  (l2p_flags.lake == 0) 
The image is an incrementally accumulated product of all the orbits over an entire day from both Sentinel-3A and -3B.
The SLSTR instrument and ground processing system are required to produce SST retrievals routinely from the corresponding brightness temperatures with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.3 K, globally, both for a single sample and when averaged over areas of 0.5° longitude by 0.5° latitude, under certain cloud-free conditions (i.e. >20% cloud-free samples within each area). The SLSTR instrument also has a temporal stability of 0.1 K/decade.

The product is composed from data from a combination of the following OLCI bands: 0a02_radiance, Oa06_radiance, Oa08_radiance. The images are generated with a pixel resolution of 0.09 degrees.
'Ocean colour' is the change in the colour of the ocean, and other water bodies such as lakes, due to the substances dissolved and particles suspended within the water. The primary objective of OLCI products is to measure the colour of the ocean and land surface and provide information on ocean and land characteristics related to this (e.g. biology). OLCI also provides information on the atmosphere and contributes to climate studies. Sentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme."""@en ;

concentration in clear open waters, and it is defined by the "OC4Me" Maximum Band Ratio
(MBR) semi-analytical algorithm. The product is derived from S3A OLCI L2 NRT water-leaving
reflectances (calculated from the Baseline Atmospheric Correction). A maximum band ratio
approach is used for reflectances at 443, 490 and 510 nm, over that 560 nm (O3 to O6). It
is expressed in Units of mg/m3 as: log10 [Chl]= ∑4 x=0 =(Ax * (log10(Rij))x) which is the
ratio of reflectance of band i, among 443, 490 and 510 nm, over that of band j at 560 nm.
The following flags were applied: INVALID, LAND, CLOUD, CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS, CLOUD_MARGIN,
SNOW_ICE, SUSPECT, HISOLZEN, SATURATED, HIGHGLINT, WHITECAPS, AC_FAIL, OC4ME_FAIL,
ANNOT_TAU06, RWNEG_O2, RWNEG_O3, RWNEG_O4, RWNEG_O5, RWNEG_O6, RWNEG_O7 and RWNEG_O8. Full

    dcterms:description """Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is the kinetic temperature of a water
body at a defined depth. Although SLSTR measures an infrared radiometric temperature, it
is provided as a kinetic temperature by considering the emissivity of the water body as
part of the SST retrieval process. It is important to note that the SLSTR instruments
return SST measurements for the ocean 'skin'. Due to the limited penetration of thermal
infra-red radiation through the water column, this corresponds to the temperature in the
top few tens of micrometres. At night, the skin temperature is typically a few tenths of a
degree cooler than the temperature measured by in situ systems; in the day, the skin can
be considerably higher if strong diurnal warming is present. For more details please see
“What is SST?” on the GHRSST web pages. The SST measurement is obtained by means of a
highly accurate calibration of the three infra-red channels at 3.74, 10.85 and 12 µm
(S7-S8-S9). Corrections for water vapour atmospheric absorption are performed using a
triple window at night, and a split window during the day as the 3.7 µm channel is not
used due to solar contamination. Each on-ground pixel is viewed twice, via nadir and
oblique views with different atmospheric path lengths, allowing for correction for aerosol
effects. Consequently, there are four possible retrieved SSTs, referred to as N2
(nadir-only 11 µm and 12 µm), N3 (nadir-only 3.7 µm, 11 µm and 12 µm), D2 (dual-view 11 µm
and 12 µm) and D3 (dual-view 3.7 µm, 11 µm and 12 µm). A fifth retrieval algorithm, N3R is
similar to N3, but uses the property of “aerosol robustness”, which is applicable in areas
of high atmospheric aerosol content, e.g. near volcanoes. The product is derived from
SLSTR L2 NRT data following derivation was applied to select the SST pixels to be plotted
from WST file: - if the observation is in the nadir-only / single-view part of swath (i.e.
"sst_algorithm_types" is N2, N3, N3R) then SST = sea_surface_temperature - If the
observation is in the dual-view part of swath ((i.e. "sst_algorithm_types" is D2 or D3)
then SST = sea_surface_temperature - dual_nadir_sst_difference. Besides, the following
flags were used to select which pixels to represent and display: (quality_level >=3) and
(l2p_flags.land == 0) and (l2p_flags.lake == 0) The SLSTR instrument and ground processing
system are required to produce SST retrievals routinely from the corresponding brightness
temperatures with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.3 K, globally, both for a single
sample and when averaged over areas of 0.5° longitude by 0.5° latitude, under certain
cloud-free conditions (i.e. >20% cloud-free samples within each area). The SLSTR
instrument also has a temporal stability of 0.1 K/decade.

The indicated time represents the end of the last orbit (when the satellite crosses the equator in the ascending node).
The IR10.8 channel is an atmospheric window channel (where the absorption of the gas molecules is low), and it helps in distinguishing thick clouds by to their cloud top temperatures. 
The accumulated images are displayed mapping the same temperature range for day and night, i.e. 220 K-310 K, in order to have quite homogeneous images during the entire 24 hours and also to have a good contrast in the polar regions.
The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is a multipurpose imaging instrument used for global monitoring of cloud cover, sea surface temperature, ice, snow and vegetation cover characteristics. It operates at 6 different channels simultaneously at a spatial resolution of about 1 Km near-nadir.
AVHRR has many applications in oceanography, meteorology and terrestrial sciences:
- Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) is the main geophysical parameter of use in AVHRR oceanographic applications.
- Another oceanographic application of AVHRR data is in the study of sea ice. Properly filtered for clouds over ice, AVHRR imagery can be used to compute sea ice concentration, type and ice edge location. It can also be used to compute ice motion.
- Multi-channel imagery from the AVHRR has also proven to be useful in snow cover mapping. The frequent coverage of the AVHRR is the prime advantage in being able to distinguish clouds from snow cover with their similar albedo signature. Combined with topographic relief information, snow cover from AVHRR can be converted to snow-water equivalent to give an estimate of the amount of water reserve represented by the winter snow pack.
- Day and night cloud mapping is the main application of AVHRR data in meteorology, especially at high latitudes where data from geostationary satellites are severely affected by Earth curvature. AVHRR's frequent day/night synoptic coverage and high horizontal resolution are features that make the system unique for the study of land surface."""@en ;

The indicated time represents the end of the last orbit (when the satellite crosses the equator in the ascending node). This product provides in cloudy areas information on cloud thickness and cloud top temperature, and on green vegetation fraction in cloud-free areas ('chlorophyll content': the more green vegetation there is, the greener the pixel). This RGB type is most useful during the convective periods since core and anvil of convective clouds can be seen clearly.

    dcterms:description "This is an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) composite image based upon data from solar and infrared channels from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3). The images are a combination of two AVHRR RGB composite products: the Natural Colour (daytime product based on solar channels) and Night Microphysics (i.e. Fog) product (based upon infrared channels, tuned for night-time conditions). The product displays images composed of the last six AVHRR orbits, using the Natural Colour product in the daytime part and the Fog product in the night-time part. The indicated time represents the end of the last orbit (when the satellite crosses the equator in the ascending node). Natural Colour RGB images are created by combining data from three solar channels: 1.6 µm channel (NIR1.61, visualized in red), 0.87 µm channel (NIR0.87, visualized in green) and 0.63 µm channel (VIS0.63, visualized in blue). Its purpose is to supply general cloud analysis, by providing information on cloud top phase and cloud optical thickness in cloudy areas, and on the green vegetation fraction ('chlorophyll content') in cloud-free areas. In most cases, water clouds can be distinguished from ice clouds. Snow-covered land is easy to distinguish from snow-free land and from water clouds and fog. The colours are (relatively) close to the natural colours of the depicted features. The Night Microphysics RGB (i.e. RGB Fog) images are created by combining data from the 12.0, 10.8 and 3.74 µm channels (IR12.0, IR10.8 and IR3.74 respectively). Brightness temperature differences are displayed in red (IR12.0- IR10.8) and green (IR12.0- IR3.9), while the IR10.8 channel is shown in blue beam. Its main purpose is to distinguish fog and low clouds from cloud-free areas at night, but it contains also information on cloud top temperature, cloud optical thickness and cloud top phase, thus revealing other cloud types. Cloud-free areas contain information on low-level moisture and surface temperature. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3) is a multipurpose imaging instrument used for global monitoring of cloud cover, sea surface temperature, ice, snow and vegetation cover characteristics. It operates at six different channels simultaneously at a spatial resolution of about 1 Km near-nadir. AVHRR has many applications in oceanography, meteorology and terrestrial sciences."@en ;

The indicated time represents the end of the last orbit (when the satellite crosses the equator in the ascending node).
The IR10.8 channel is an atmospheric window channel (where the absorption of the gas molecules is low), and it helps in distinguishing thick clouds by to their cloud top temperatures. 
The accumulated images are displayed mapping the same temperature range for day and night, i.e. 220 K-310 K, in order to have quite homogeneous images during the entire 24 hours and also to have a good contrast in the polar regions.
The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is a multipurpose imaging instrument used for global monitoring of cloud cover, sea surface temperature, ice, snow and vegetation cover characteristics. It operates at 6 different channels simultaneously at a spatial resolution of about 1 Km near-nadir.
AVHRR has many applications in oceanography, meteorology and terrestrial sciences:
- Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) is the main geophysical parameter of use in AVHRR oceanographic applications.
- Another oceanographic application of AVHRR data is in the study of sea ice. Properly filtered for clouds over ice, AVHRR imagery can be used to compute sea ice concentration, type and ice edge location. It can also be used to compute ice motion.
- Multi-channel imagery from the AVHRR has also proven to be useful in snow cover mapping. The frequent coverage of the AVHRR is the prime advantage in being able to distinguish clouds from snow cover with their similar albedo signature. Combined with topographic relief information, snow cover from AVHRR can be converted to snow-water equivalent to give an estimate of the amount of water reserve represented by the winter snow pack.
- Day and night cloud mapping is the main application of AVHRR data in meteorology, especially at high latitudes where data from geostationary satellites are severely affected by Earth curvature. AVHRR's frequent day/night synoptic coverage and high horizontal resolution are features that make the system unique for the study of land surface."""@en ;

The Night Microphysics RGB (i.e. RGB Fog) images are created by combining data from the 12.0, 10.8 and 3.74 µm channels (IR12.0, IR10.8 and IR3.74 respectively). Brightness temperature differences are displayed in red (IR12.0- IR10.8) and green (IR12.0- IR3.9), while the IR10.8 channel is shown in blue beam. Its main purpose is to distinguish fog and low clouds from cloud-free areas at night, but it contains also information on cloud top temperature, cloud optical thickness and cloud top phase, thus revealing other cloud types. Cloud-free areas contain information on low-level moisture and surface temperature. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3) is a multipurpose imaging instrument used for global monitoring of cloud cover, sea surface temperature, ice, snow and vegetation cover characteristics. It operates at six different channels simultaneously at a spatial resolution of about 1 Km near-nadir. AVHRR has many applications in oceanography, meteorology and terrestrial sciences."@en ;

It is designed and tuned to monitor the distribution of different air masses and evolution of cyclones, in particular rapid cyclogenesis, jet streaks and to validate the location of PV (potential vorticity) anomalies in model data. 
Due to the incorporation of the water vapour and ozone channels, its usage at highest satellite viewing angles is limited (limb cooling effect). Being based solely on IR channels this product has the same utility both during day and night."""@en ;

Every single imagery composing the final product, is generated by assigning red, green and blue to imageries based upon brightness temperature difference (BDT) between the two water vapour channels, infrared and visible solar channels data from the following instruments:
- SEVIRI (Meteosat): WV6.2, WV7.3, IR3.9, IR10.8, NIR1.6, VIS0.6 channels.
- ABI (GOES-16 and GOES-17):  WV6.2, WV7.3, IR3.9, IR10.3, NIR1.6, VIS0.64 channels.
- AHI (Himawari-8): WV6.2, WV7.3, IR3.9, IR10.4, NIR1.6, VIS0.64 channels.

This product is useful to emphasize convection with strong updrafts and small ice particles indicative of severe storms and helps in identifying the early stage of strong convection. 
Severe convective storms appear bright yellow in this colour scheme because of the near zero BTD WV6.2-WV7.3 of overshooting Cb clouds. The strong updrafts in these clouds produce small ice particles at cloud tops due to homogeneous freezing of cloud drops, resulting with large BTD IR3.9-IR10.8 (green). Finally, large negative values of NIR1.6-VIS0.6 because of the large absorption at NIR1.6 by ice particles keeps the blue very low. 
Please note that small ice crystals of Cirrus clouds should not be confused with vigorous convection. Inferred small ice crystals that are not associated with anvils of Cb clouds must form by elevated strong updrafts, such as in high altitude orographic wave clouds.
Product is limited to daytime utility, high Sun zenith and high satellite scanning angles."""@en ;

The product may be processed in different ways and have different quality depending on the surface being flat, forested or mountainous. The algorithm is based on multi-channel analysis of AVHRR, the most important being those in shortwave, thus the product is generated in daylight. The “deficit” of brightness in respect of the maximum one is correlated to the lack of snow in the product resolution element. In the case of forests, the expected maximum brightness (or the “transmissivity”) is evaluated in advance by a high-resolution instrument (MODIS). In order to search for cloud-free pixels, multi-temporal analysis is performed over all images available in 24 hours (in daylight)."@en ;

They are available as monthly and daily averages. Surface albedo is presented as monthly and pentad (5 day) averages of the broadband black-sky albedo and is derived using all available data during the studied period. Surface radiation is provided as monthly and daily averages for the downwelling shortwave component. All monthly, pentad and daily averages are available on a 0.25°x0.25° global grid.

The albedo quantifies the part of the energy that is absorbed and transformed into heat and latent fluxes. Owing to strong feedback effects the knowledge of albedo is important for determining weather conditions at the atmospheric boundary layer. Climate sensitivity studies with Global Circulation Models have confirmed the unsteady nature of the energy balance with respect to small changes in surface albedo. Other domains of applications are in hydro-meteorology, agro-meteorology and environment-related studies."@en ;

It is defined as half the total area of green elements per unit horizontal ground area accounting for the amount of green vegetation that absorbs or scatters solar radiation. It provides complementary information to the FVC, accounting for the surface of leaves contained in a vertical column normalized by its cross-sectional area. It defines thus the area of green vegetation that interacts with solar radiation determining the remote sensing signal, and represents the size of the interface between the vegetation canopy and the atmosphere for energy and mass exchanges. LAI is thus a necessary input for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), regional and global climate modeling, weather forecasting and global change monitoring."@en ;

For users interested in either ASCAT backscatter, wind or soil moisture index data in other formats, please refer to the relevant product entries available for the specific parameters. Finally, note that although the OSI SAF is identified as the originating centre for this product, it is not responsible for the processing of soil moisture index values, which is currently carried out at EUMETSAT. Better than using this archived NRT product, please use the reprocessed ASCAT winds data records (EO:EUM:DAT:METOP:OSI-150-A, EO:EUM:DAT:METOP:OSI-150-B).

    dcterms:description "Land surface albedo is a key variable for characterising the energy balance in the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. The albedo quantifies the part of the energy that is absorbed and transformed into heat and latent fluxes. Owing to strong feedback effects the knowledge of albedo is important for determining weather conditions at the atmospheric boundary layer. Climate sensitivity studies with Global Circulation Models have confirmed the unsteady nature of the energy balance with respect to small changes in surface albedo. Other domains of applications are in hydro-meteorology, agro-meteorology and environment-related studies. Two products are pre-operational, the first is available daily and the second is a 10 day composite (See distribution for details)."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The down-welling surface short-wave radiation flux (DSSF) refers to the radiative energy in the wavelength interval [0.3 microns, 4.0 microns] reaching the Earth's surface per time and surface unit. It essentially depends on the solar zenith angle, on cloud coverage, and to a lesser extent on atmospheric absorption and surface albedo. DSSF fields are crucial for a wide number of applications involving scientific domains like weather forecast, hydrology, climate, agriculture and environment-related studies. In numerical weather prediction and general circulation models of the atmosphere, satellite-derived DSSF estimates can either be used as a control variable or as a substitute to surface radiation measurement networks. Two products are operationally available, the first is available every 30 minutes and the second is a composite daily product (See distribution for details)."@en ;

    dcterms:description "The Fire Radiative Power product (FRP, in megawatts) provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. It has been demonstrated in small-scale experimental fires that the amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed. This is a direct result of the combustion process, whereby carbon-based fuel is oxidised to CO2 with the release of a certain heat yield. Therefore, measuring this FRP and integrating it over the lifetime of the fire provides an estimate of the total Fire Radiative Energy (FRE), which for wildfires should be proportional to the total mass of fuel biomass combusted. Geostationary observations allow high temporal frequency FRP measurements, and thus a much-improved ability to estimate FRE via temporal integration when compared to the far less-frequent observations made from systems in low-Earth orbit. The FRP product is derived every 15 min at the native SEVIRI pixel resolution. The disseminated product includes for each processed pixel, the FRP (MW), the corresponding uncertainty in the FRP retrieval based on the variability of the background radiance estimation, and a confidence measure (representing the level of confidence that the observation is indeed a true fire). Applications: The FRP product is intended to support emerging operational atmosphere and climate-related applications, such as Air quality forecasting, Carbon cycle assessment and modelling, and Fire activity models."@en ;

In this colour scheme vegetation appears greenish because of its large reflectance in the VIS0.8 channel (the green beam) compared to the NIR1.6 (red beam) and VIS0.6 (blue beam) channels. Water clouds with small droplets have large reflectance at all three channels and hence appear whitish, while snow and ice clouds appears cyan because ice strongly absorbs in NIR1.6 (no red). Bare ground appears brown because of the larger reflectance in the NIR1.6 than at VIS0.6, and the ocean appears black because of the low reflectance in all three channels.

Channel 3 switches between 3a and 3b for daytime and nighttime. As a high-resolution imager (about 1.1 km near nadir) its main purpose is to provide cloud and surface information such as cloud coverage, cloud top temperature, surface temperature over land and sea, and vegetation or snow/ice. In addition, AVHRR products serve as input for the level 2 processing of IASI and ATOVS. The global products from AVHRR on NOAA satellites are only available at Global Area Coverage (GAC) spatial sampling, namely 5.4 km across track x 3.2 km along track at nadir."@en ;

The enhanced measurement data file contains also the waveforms and associated  parameters and the pseudo LRM measurements when in SAR mode. Sentinel-3 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme. This product contains the following datasets: Sea Level Global(STC) (PDS_MG3_CORE_14_GLOSTC), Sea Level Global Reduced(STC) (PDS_MG3_CORE_14_GLOSTC_RD), Sea Level Global Standard(STC) (PDS_MG3_CORE_14_GLOSTC_SD), Sea Level Global Enhanced(STC) (PDS_MG3_CORE_14_GLOSTC_EN)."@en ;

    dcterms:description """When a natural disaster or disease outbreak occurs there is a rush to establish accurate health care location data that can be used to support people on the ground. This has been demonstrated by events such as the Haiti earthquake and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. As a result valuable time is wasted establishing accurate and accessible baseline data.
Healthsites.io establishes this data and the tools necessary to upload, manage and make the data easily accessible.

Global scope
The Global Healthsites Mapping Project is an initiative to create an online map of every health facility in the world and make the details of each location easily accessible.

Open data collaboration
Through collaborations with users, trusted partners and OpenStreetMap the Global Healthsites Mapping Project will capture and validate the location and contact details of every facility and make this data freely available under an Open Data License (ODBL).

Accessible
The Global Healthsites Mapping Project will make the data accessible over the Internet through an API and other formats such as GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML, CSV.

Focus on health care location data
The Global Healthsites Mapping Project's design philosophy is the long term curation and validation of health care location data. The healthsites.io map will enable users to discover what healthcare facilities exist at any global location and the associated services and resources."""@en ;

The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set. The net calorific value and the elementary composition of the waste fraction or specific waste are shown in the tables beneath (see corresponding column in the tables). The data set covers all relevant process steps / technologies over the supply chain of the represented cradle to gate inventory with a good overall data quality.

In comparative studies on tubes for various plumbing systems, e.g. drinking water, heating and gas, it is misleading to simply consider the impact of 1 m of tube made from different materials. Plumbing systems are normally designed to transport specified volumes of fluids, with different tube diameters and wall thicknesses required dependent on the choice of material. In addition, consideration must be given to the different design practices, installation and jointing standards and regulatory requirements for each. Many cradle to grave life cycle assessment studies have shown that the environmental aspects from the use and end of life phases of products are often significant. The economic value of copper scrap, based on its ability to be recycled 100% without any loss in performance, must be included in comparative assessments.

The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set.

It should be noted that it might be appropriate to consider the production of these materials when conducting a LCA study on beverage cartons. It is recommended to contact ACE regarding the question if this LCI dataset on converting is applicable in a specific study context. It is recommended to contact the beverage carton producer regarding detailed material composition of the beverage carton under examination. Note: VOC emissions from process depend on the printing technology applied and could considerably differ from the average value given here for a specific site or beverage carton product. Note: Air emissions from on-site fuel use for a specific site depend on the actually applied flue gas cleaning technology. This technology could be different from the average technology underlying this dataset in case of a particular site or in a regional context with a particular legal framework. Area of beverage cartons have to be calculated into mass of raw materials needed by the user. (advice can be requested at ACE). This parameterised data set is a gate-to gate data set that lists the inputs and outputs directly connected to the converting of LDPE granulate, liquid packaging board and aluminium foil to beverage carton. Beverage Cartons vary widely in composition depending on filled product and required functionality. There is therefore no one average carton or carton composition. The converting process is however broadly similar for all cartons and the representative parameterised process is designed to allow users to enter the appropriate package specification i.e. how much liquid packaging board, aluminium foil and plastic resin is used in the particular package under study, as well as specify the appropiate electricity supply for the converting factory location. For guidance a typical one litre aseptic carton for milk might for example comprise 78.5% board, 16.5% PE and 5% aluminum foil; while a typcial one litre chilled carton could be 82.5% liquid packaging board and 17.5% LDPE. For more specific guidance on package specification please contact ACE or the specific package material provider. This data set is intended for the use by LCA practitioners

Technical Purpose: Beverage Cartons are used for the packaging of non-carbonated softdrinks, milk and other liquid dairy products and non-carbonated

Synonyms: Poly(methyl) methacrylate, methyl methacrylate resin

Technical Purpose: Its durability, plus its high quality finish, ensures that it is in demand for the longer lasting high quality products, such as
 baths, sinks and showers. Its mechanical properties of high softening point and high impact strength, when combined with its good weatherability and resistance to most
 aqueous inorganic reagents, favour its use in external applications. Illuminated signs, glazing and motor vehicle rear lights are only a few of the examples of the use to
 which it can be put. Because of its optical clarity and stability, PMMA has found uses in the medical field where special grades have long been successfully employed for
 intra-ocular lenses, contact lenses and implants and film. Besides self-polymerisation, methyl methacrylate (MMA), will polymerise with a range of other materials, yielding
 co-polymers with properties tailored to specific applications.

 injection moulded components (automotive parts, consumer goods, etc.) Other smaller uses are films and filaments. Nylon 66 is often selected for use because of its
 combination of toughness, stiffness, high melting point and chemical resistance. It is a relatively easy polymer to modify, so the range of different nylon resins available
 is wider than for most other polymers. Typical modifiers are flame retardants to reduce flammability, rubber to improve impact resistance and glass or minerals to improve
 stiffness and dimensional stability

The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set.

The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set.

Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set. The net calorific value and the elementary composition of the waste fraction or specific waste are shown in the tables beneath (see corresponding column in the tables). The data set covers all relevant process steps / technologies over the supply chain of the represented cradle to gate inventory with a good overall data quality. The inventory is mainly based on industry data and is completed, where necessary, by secondary data.

Plumbing systems are normally designed to transport specified volumes of fluids, with different tube diameters and wall thicknesses required dependent on the choice of material. In addition, consideration must be given to the different design practices, installation and jointing standards and regulatory requirements for each. Many cradle to grave life cycle assessment studies have shown that the environmental aspects from the use and end of life phases of products are often much more significant.

Data collected on site by steel industry experts in accordance with the worldsteel methodology and ISO 14040 standards, and consistency-checked by worldsteel LCA-experts. Global coke, sinter, pellet, hot metal, slab production based on wordsteel site specific data. Metallurgical coal data based on global IEA statistics and information from the GaBi database. Iron ore data obtained from iron ore producer. Other upstream data based on the GaBi database, including country specific electricity. The LCI does not include any further processing beyond the steelworks gate such as bending, shaping, cutting, welding etc. The LCI includes credits and burdens associated with end of life recycling, applying a burden to the scrap input and a credit for recycling of the product at end of its life. Therefore, end of life recycling does not need to be modelled separately. Burdens associated with shredding and baling at end of life are not included.

Synonyms: Steel hot rolled coil (HRC)

Technical Purpose: Steel coil rolled on a hot-strip mill. It can be found on the market in coil or in sheets and is further processed into finished
 products by the manufacturers. The various types of hot rolled steel have applications in virtually all sectors of industry: transport, construction, shipbuilding, gas
 containers, pressure vessels, energy pipelines, etc. Hot rolled steel sheet with an anti-slip surface and a diamond or teardrop pattern are typically used for stairs,
 industrial floors and tailboards for goods vehicles.

    dcterms:description """The European average Waste-to-Energy plant (WtE) is defined based on the treatment of average European municipal solid waste (MSW). The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath). The following technology description explains the settings and technology of the average WtE plant used to generate the LCI data set. The net calorific value and the elementary composition of the waste fraction or specific waste are shown in the tables beneath (see corresponding column in the tables). The data set covers all relevant process steps / technologies over the supply chain of the represented cradle to gate inventory with a good overall data quality. The inventory is mainly based on industry data and is completed, where necessary, by secondary data.

The thermal treatment of a single waste fraction like paper or plastic or even specific wastes like Polyamide 6 is not done in reality in a WtE plant for MSW. The waste is always homogenized to obtain a relative constant calorific value and to comply with the emission standards. Nonetheless the used model and the used settings for the average MSW allows to attribute the environmental burden (emissions and also resource consumption of auxiliaries) energy production as well as the credits (metal scrap export) to a single fraction or specific waste incinerated within an average MSW. Therefore the LCI data is valid for the treatment of the specific waste within an average MSW (the waste fraction share of the MSW is shown in the pie chart beneath, the elementary composition in the first table beneath).

Technical Purpose: About two thirds of the nylon produced in Europe is used for fibres (textiles, carpets, etc.) while most of the remainder is used in
 injection moulded components (automotive parts, consumer goods, etc.) Other smaller uses are films and filaments. Nylon 66 is often selected for use because of its
 combination of toughness, stiffness, high melting point and chemical resistance. It is a relatively easy polymer to modify, so the range of different nylon resins available
 is wider than for most other polymers. Typical modifiers are flame retardants to reduce flammability, rubber to improve impact resistance and glass or minerals to improve
 stiffness and dimensional stability
