    dcterms:description """A significant increase in young people with a pro-European mind-set cast a vote in the 2019 European elections, according to a European Parliament’s in-depth Eurobarometer survey. Conducted in the weeks after the elections across all 28 Member States, nearly 28.000 citizens answered questions about their participation in the European elections and the issues that motivated them to vote.\r
\r
Citizens’ support for the European Union remains at its highest level since 1983, as 68% of respondents say that their country has benefitted from being a member of the EU.\r
\r
Even more significant for the democratic legitimacy of the EU is the steep increase in European citizens believing that ‘their voice counts in the EU’: 56% of respondents share this view, an increase of 7 points since March 2019 and the highest result since this question was first asked in 2002.\r
\r
The overall turnout in the European elections 2019 increased by 8 points to 50,6%, resulting in the highest participation since 1994 and for the first time a reversal of turnout since 1979. It was Europe’s young and first time voters who drove turnout figures up: With 42% of the 16/18-24 year old citizens voting in the European elections, their participation rose by 50%, compared to the youth turnout of only 28% in 2014. Similarly strong was the 34% increase in the age group of 25-39 years, rising from 35% to 47%.\r
\r
52% of voters said they voted in the European elections as they saw it as their civic duty, a plus of 11 points compared to 2014. Compared to the European elections 2014, significantly more citizens have also voted because they are in favour of the EU (25%, +11pp), or because they felt they could change things by voting (18%, +6pp). In 27 Member States, citizens primarily voted because they saw it as their duty as citizens, in all 28 Member States more respondents than in 2014 voted because they were in favour of the EU.\r
\r
Looking at the issues that made citizens vote, the post-electoral survey shows that top issues which impacted on citizens’ voting decision were economy and growth (44%), climate change (37%) as well as human rights and democracy (37%). With 36% of mentions ‘the way the EU should be working in the future’ emerged also as top voting motivator for citizens."""@en ;

It is part of the Meetnetten.be suite of monitoring networks for priority species in Flanders, in which data are collected at fixed locations using a standardized protocol (https://meetnetten.be). This dataset contains transect data for 3 priority dragonfly species, as well as other dragonflies observed during sampling. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an eventID, date, location and sampling protocol (in the event core), the length of the transect (in the measurement or fact extension) and for each occurrence an occurrenceID, the number of recorded individuals, status (present/absent), life stage, sex and scientific name (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/meetnetten-occurrences/issues

Generalized and/or withheld information: as these are sensitive priority species, location information is generalized to 1, 5 or 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells. Original locations are available upon request.

Activation reason: <br/> 
A wildfire is raging from Monday noon in the west sector of Attica region at Pateras mountain, burning down large forests rural and urban areas. The moderate wind and high flammability of forest fuels due to prolonged draught, make the work of firefighters very difficult. The residential communities of Mikro or Mega Bathyhori, Agios Georgios, Agia Paraskeyi, Kryo Pigadi, Palaiohori and Beniza have been evacuated for precautionary reasons. According to Fire Service 330 firefighters with 115 vehicles are currently operating in the area, assisted by eight (8) ground force group, including forces deployed by the European Civil Protection Mechanism, 143 firefighters from Poland with 46 vehicles, six (6) helicopters and five (5) planes including Beriev-200.

    dcterms:description """This dataset series refers to the information on burnt areas and fire severity provided by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). ▷_How to cite: see below_◁
  

1 - Burnt areas.
The burnt area mapping is a service implemented since 2000 that detects and analyzes the evolution of the fire events during the fire seasons and since 2007 during the whole year. A burnt area monitored in the EFFIS system is an area damaged by a wildfire event; in the system only areas that are about 30 hectares or larger are detected. Fires occurred only on agricultural areas are not mapped. A wildfire event can start either from an agricultural area or from a wildland area. Irrespective of the ignition point, to be considered in EFFIS a fire event must damage a wildland area. This means that the fire was either generated in the natural areas by spontaneous or anthropogenic sources, or sparked in agricultural fields and went out of control up to damage wildland. The mapping provided by EFFIS is on a day-by-day basis, and integrates multiple sources: the fire news, the MODIS and VIIRS satellite thermal anomalies, the near real-time (NRT) fire monitoring based on them, and the MODIS Terra and Aqua images. The NRT Fire Monitoring is useful to obtain an early approximation of the last state of large fires with a short time-lag. A subsequent integrated analysis generates consolidated best estimates of the burnt area. Each day, a semi-automatic procedure takes as input the satellite images and runs an automated classification. The burn scars automatically detected with the thermal anomalies, along with the fire news geolocations, serve as auxiliary data for the final visual check through a computer assisted photointerpretation by a GIS analysts / expert photointerpreter who verifies the reliability of the candidate areas. Once confirmed, the final polygons of the burnt area product contains multiple information fields: affected area in hectares; spatial location (country, province, and municipality); and temporal window (start and end dates of the fires, and date of the last update of the events).

2 - Fire severity.

Fire severity is the degree to which a fire altered the burnt area. It is assessed by EFFIS using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index (also sensitive to chlorophyll, water content, vegetation, ash), computed for pre-fire and post-fire satellite images. The “differenced NBR” (dNBR) represents the difference between NBR values before and after the event. The estimated “differenced NBR” is remapped into five categories of severity (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high).

 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in La Rioja region (North-Eastern Spain) on 18th July 2021. Within the municipalities of Autol, Gr&aacute;valos, Quel and Villarroya more than 200 hectares of wooden areas have burnt. The event affected also more than 360 hectares in the lung of La Rioja Baja, but it was managed to save Mount Yerga in Autol and the protected area of the Carrascal de Villarroya. More than 200 people worked in order to extinguish the forest fire, which was finally extinguished two days after.The goal of the activation has been to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation.The P07 Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 293 ha burnt, of which 165 ha only slightly damaged, 125 ha moderately damaged, and 2 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that infrastructure assets with higher commercial value are those of the wind power park located along the ridgeline of the hilly forested area inside the AOI. Nine of the 66 wind power generators were directly affected by the fire and 2 others were in proximity to the estimated fire boundary. In terms of area, the broad-leaved forests and sclerophyllous vegetation suffered the highest total damage, but they are also the two most common vegetation types in the AOI. The damage to the agricultural sector was minimal, mostly affecting non-irrigated arable land. No inhabitants were affected by the fire as the region is very sparsely populated. <br/>

Activation date: 2021-07-27 <br/> 
Event type: Wildfire <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the natural areas of Villarrasa, in the Huelva province (Andalucia region, Southern Spain) on 24th July 2021. A total of 15 aircrafts and 120 forest firefighters fought against the propagation of the wildfire which, however, reached the limits of Niebla and La Palma de Condado, affecting an area of 865 hectares, 630 hectares of which being forest.The goal of the activation is to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 846 ha burnt, of which 540 ha only slightly damaged, 299 ha moderately damaged, and 6 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the fire engulfed 5 km of primary road and nearly 5 km of unpaved roads and tracks. The infrastructure assets with higher commercial value affected by the fire are several agricultural buildings, waste and recycling industry, and power line infrastructure. In terms of area, the highest total damage was suffered in the transitional woodland-shrub and sclerophyllous vegetation and in coniferous forest. The damage to the agricultural sector was minimal, mostly affecting pastureland. Several roadside residential buildings were destroyed. <br/>

The data come from an ongoing network for the monitoring of the biological quality of running waters in Wallonia maintained under the Water Framework Directive of European Union (Directive 2000/60/CE) (European Council, 2000). The current monitoring network is composed of more than 400 sites, distributed among all streams (brooks to largest rivers/canals) from the hydrographic districts of the Meuse, the Scheldt, the Rhine and the Seine in Wallonia. Macroinvertebrates are one of the 4 indicator groups used to assess the biological quality with macrophytes, diatoms, and fishes. The macroinvertebrate occurrences are obtained by the analysis of standardized IBGN/IBGA samplings, done according a methodology derived from T90-350 (2004) French standard (see Vanden Bossche & Usseglio-Polatera, 2005 in Hydrobiologia, 551: 253-271). Some taxa encountered during the monitoring are not included into this GBIF dataset (when identification level is particularly imprecise, i.e. higher than family E.G: 'poriferans', 'Bryozoa', etc...).

Event type: Storm (Tropical cyclone, hurricane, typhoon)<br/> 
<br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
On the 8th of December, a tropical cyclone threading its way into the Mozambique Channel has intensified into a major storm with winds of 185 kilometers per hour as it heads toward a possible landfall in northern Madagascar. Cyclone Belna still has time to grow stronger, according to Météo France Reunion, the regional authority for cyclones in the southwest Indian Ocean. While the storm’s power is likely to intensify, there’s less confident about the forecast track, according to the French agency as well as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.<br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
Due to extensive rainfall and snow-melt of the last few days, and also due to large amounts of water that was released from dams in rivers Evros and Ardas, many areas of Evros Regional Unit have been flooded. 
Extensive damages are reported in agricultural land, road and railway network.
Many embankments across Evros river, broke, causing further problems.
The Regional Unit of Evros has been declared in a state of emergency

The expedition was a fishery-independent trawl-survey of the demersal communities using a bottom otter-trawl net (wing mesh-size: 55 mm; cod-end mesh-size: 22 mm; foot-rope length: 41 m; head-rope length: 32 m). The average towing speed was about 3.5 knots, and the sampling duration was 60 minutes for almost all hauls, with the exception of one haul (sampling duration of 15 minutes). Two successive trawl hauls were performed at each station, with the second towing frequently performed along the same distance but in the opposite direction. Data per stations are given as the mean value of two replicates. The survey was successively named GRUND programme and ended in 2007."@en ;

A forest fire broke out in 14-09-2019 near Loutraki City, 65 Km West from Athens. The rough terrain and the strong winds made the job of fire-fighters more difficult and carried the fire further. For precautionary reasons, the Monastery of Osios Patapios and one Elderly hospital located near the fire front were evacuated. Copernicus EMS Mapping products will be used for damage assessment, recovery rand restoration planning of the affected area and for future flood protection measures.

    dcterms:description """The EUNIS-compliant geospatial datasets concerning broadscale seabed habitat distributions that are currently available (Spring 2015) from the EMODNET portal cover only around half of the European Union (EU) waters in the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent Seas. This work focused on expeditiously complementing this coverage by bringing in, and harmonizing where needed, complementary EUNIS-compliant data from the UNEP/GRIDA Global Seafloor Geomorphic Features Map and the EEA EIONET Ecosystem Map. The polygon shapefile produced extends for approximately 8.7 million square kilometres, spreading out to the limits of the Extended Continental Shelf areas claimed in the by EU Member States in the Northeast Atlantic. This new dataset significantly improves the existing EUNIS-compliant coverage by (i) populating the deep-sea and offshore areas with previously disregarded geomorphic-based habitat classes and by (ii) adding information for EUNIS classes A1, A2, X1 and X2/X3. The coverage of EUNIS seabed habitats available is in this manner doubled in comparison to EMODNET. More than 90% of the EU waters are detailed down to EUNIS level 2 and 3 and a small part down to level 5.
The mapped extents of several habitats should still be considered geographically biased and underestimated in relation to their actual extent. This should be resolved upon completion of EMODNET's Seabed Habitats harmonized coverage, which is currently addressing the eastern Mediterranean, the Black Sea, part of Macaronesia and part of the Celtic Seas."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Context :
The bay of Portman and the adjacent shoreline are exposed to one of the most severe cases of sediments contamination by heavy metals of the whole Mediterranean Sea, due to decades of industrial mining activities which took place in the locality from 1951 to 1991.

This dataset countains fine scale distribution data for echinoderms collected around the bay of Portman (Murcia, Spain) by the Marine biology laboratory (ULB) in October 2013.

The fine scale cartography was realized for both the contamination gradient pattern and the benthic species distribution within the study area.

Environmental data are gathered into the Measurement or Facts extension. Most of these data concern heavy metal concentrations (Fe,Cu,Cd,Pb,Zn), for both the total and the finest (particle size <63µm) granulometric fractions of the sediments. 

Benthic species distribution data are compiled in a DarwinCore archive. The major part of the data are derived from imagery-based identifications on video transects operated with a micro-ROV (VideoRay PRO3 GTO). But it also countains observations made by scuba divers, ad hoc observations, and sampled specimens for the purpose of physiological/ecotoxicological studies."""@en ;

Activation reason: <br/> 
The EMSN057 service provides geospatial information facilitating assessment of drivers of ground subsidence and to supporting analysis of the relation between detected ground subsidence and land use changes in Ca Mau, Long Xuyen and Rach Gia areas in the Mekong delta, Vietnam. The primary objective of the service is provision of spatially and temporally consistent, dense and synoptic results giving insight on the distribution and variance of subsidence phenomena in space and its dynamics in time. The persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) technique, measuring ground deformations from stacks of archive SAR imagery (Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X), was utilized to estimate displacements. Products should complement ground based measurements, information from previous InSAR studies and contribute to evidence-based risk assessment.Annual Ground Subsidence Displacement&nbsp;The raster product, with 10 x 10m resolution, shows annual ground subsidence displacements in the vertical direction. The product was interpolated from displacement values of persistent scatterer points detected by the PSI technique from a stack of archived satellite SAR images.Annual Ground Subsidence Displacement ChangeThe change product shows differences of annual ground subsidence displacements in the vertical direction. It was obtained by deduction of previous from subsequent annual versions of Displacement products.In addition, average annual subsidence displacement velocity and displacement trend were evaluated from the PSI results, as demonstrated below.&nbsp; <br/>

Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone.

    dcterms:description """The dataset aggregates the results from a pan-European multi-site experiment, financially supported by the ALTER-Net consortium, Europe’s Ecosystem Research Network. In this multi-site experiment, the impact of dung beetle assemblages on dung decomposition and secondary seed dispersal was studied.
Working at a multi-site level allowed us to study the link between ecosystem functions of dung removal and secondary seed dispersal, and dung beetle diversity and abundance in a broad range of bioclimatic zones. Therefore, grazed grasslands throughout the Western Palaearctic zone were included in the experiment. By experimentally manipulating the access of certain dung beetle functional groups to the experimental units, we were able to estimate the value of each functional group for ecosystem functioning and assess the impact of predicted climate change on these processes through the changes it induces in dung beetle assemblage composition.
During the experiments, the removal of different types of dung and seeds were measured and the dung beetle assemblage composition was determined using different types of dung as bait. The experiments took place between 2013 and 2016, at 17 study sites in 10 countries within the Western Palaearctic realm. The dung beetle occurrence data set contains all dung beetle specimens sampled during the 4-week experimental periods at each sampling site.

It contains information on 23 alien fish species occurring in Flemish natural and semi-natural waterbodies, detected in sampling between 1992 and 2006. This species checklist was assessed within the framework of the Freshwater Fish Monitoring Network by Verreycken et al. (2007) and reassessed for Verreycken et al. (2018). Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, kingdom, and stable taxon identifier (in the taxon core), the Dutch and English vernacular name (in the vernacular names extension), the year of first introduction and last assessment in Flanders (given as a year range in the event date in the distribution extension), coarse habitat information (in the species profile extension) and the pathway(s) of introduction, native range(s), and invasion stage in Flanders (in the description extension). The dataset can be used for researching and managing aquatic invasions or compiling regional and national registries of alien species.

    dcterms:description "The SINPHONIE project established a scientific/technical network to act at the EU level with the long-term perspective of improving air quality in schools and kindergartens, thereby reducing the risk and burden of respiratory diseases among children and teachers potentially due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. At the same time, the project supports future policy actions by formulating guidelines, recommendations and risk management options for better air quality and associated health effects in schools. SINPHONIE was initiated and funded by the European Parliament. It was carried out under a contract with the European CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO). The project was conceived as a challenging pilot research project in the fields of health and environment, targeting mainly indoor air in schools but also outdoor air in the school vicinity, including consideration of the impacts of traffic and climate change. The multidisciplinary project was designed to run for two years (2010-2012). It covered most European countries, including some EU accession countries, and aimed to survey schools and establish an observatory network in Europe on school indoor pollution and health. Besides the ultimate objective of improving air quality in schools and kindergartens in the long term, the project also paid special attention to improving overall IAQ assessment in European schools and to elaborating methods and procedures for undertaking wide-scale surveys and auditing, which are essential tools in IAQ monitoring and building assessments. Gaining an understanding of children exposure to particular indoor air pollutants and evaluating the associated potential health outcomes are prerequisites for providing appropriate support to policy making and action. The SINPHONIE consortium involved 38 partners from 25 countries, and one associated partner from Belgium. The partners contributed broad expertise in the fields of health, exposure, sources and IAQ-related policies, as well as some of the comfort parameters associated with the management of building envelopes and ventilation. Overall, 114 primary schools in 23 European countries participated in the environment and health monitoring and assessment. By capitalising on existing knowledge and sources, the SINPHONIE project attempted to extend the range of available information covering old and new EU member states and some accession countries using a comprehensive procedure"@en ;

This Copernicus EMS Risk &amp; Recovery Mapping STD activation was triggered by Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK), Germany on behalf of The Technical Relief Agency (THW) that is active in Iraq since November 2013. One of the main use would be to support a joint exercise with local authorities in Bagdad and Erbil, region north of Bagdad.The first exercise aims at simulating a dam breach at Lake Hamrin (north of Bagdad and the city of Baqubah). THW would like to know whether a potential flood wave, caused by such a dam breach, would potentially affect (i) the city of Baqubah or even (ii) the airport in the western part of Bagdad. The second exercise, which will consist of mapping, will take place in the city of Shaqlawa near Erbil, and will require detailed reference maps.According to the End User&rsquo;s (EU) request, the activation focuses on the 3 following AOIs:AOI01: SHAQLAWA (93 km2)AOI02: BAQUBAH (98 km2)AOI03: HAMRIN-BAGHDAD (1,976 km2)The delivered RRM Standard products are:P02-Reference datasets over the city of Shaqlawa (1:5000) and Baqubah (1:10000)Dam break simulation at Hamrin Lake and modellization (P05) of the maximum flood extent and depth up to Baghdad.Mapbooks (P13) for displaying respective results on detailed maps <br/>

EMSN063 was activated to support the&nbsp;World Food Program in order to provide information about cropland change and population affected by cropland loss in the north-eastern Nigerian Borno region over 5 AOIs, helping to understand the food security situation. The area under focus is has not been accessed for several years and little to no data could be collected due to intense fighting activities by Boko Haram since 2010.The aim of the activation is a crop change analysis implemented between the two reference years of &lt;2010 and 2019. The methodology is based on the generation of NDVI-composite layers per time stamp using High Resolution imagery data (Sentinel-2 for 2019, Aster and Landsat for &lt;2010). Crop change is determined per on populated site level, whereas a respective database was created based on open available data. Population data were link to each populated site to determine the affected population by cropland loss.Proposed solution and resultsGeneration of NDVI-composite layers per AOI per timestampCreation of a populated sites layer based on freely available dataCrop change analysis per populated siteImplementation of population data (source: Worldpop) per populated siteMaps showing the crop change per populated siteStatistical analysis wrt population affected by cropland lossSignificant cropland decrease (right) in the region Guzamala&nbsp;By cropland change in conflict areas affected population (2019) in Nigeria <br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Mapping (Standard)&nbsp;has been activated to assess the effects of the Eta and Iota hurricanes that hit Central America starting from the beginning of November 2020.Eta affected 4 million people across Central America, with widespread flooding, destructive winds, and devastating landslides. Weeks after, starting from 16th November 2020, Iota struck the region with even more intense weather that worsened the conditions. Heavy rainfall associated with Iota was reported also in Guatemala in a 6-hour period on 18th November.This RRM activation was requested with the&nbsp;aim of calculating the effective impacted areas, exposed population, economic losses and livelihoods, change of land use and help in reconstruction and recovery actions.Particularly, this RRM activation provides the STANDARD products Flood delineation (P04), with related Impact assessment on assets and population (P14), for an area of interest surrounding Sesajal (243km&sup2;).ResultsThe results of the activation provide a set of flood delineation (P04) products based on Sentinel-1 data, acquired after either Eta or Iota cyclone on the 10.11.2020, 16.11.2020, 22.11.2020 and 28.11.2020 (geodata available at Downloads). P04 products are associated with an estimation of the corresponding water depth (raster files available at Download).Example of P04-Flood delineation production over AOI01 Sesajal (situation as of 28.11.2020)The Impact assessment analysis on assets and population (P14) is based on the available reference datasets (i.e. OSM), the flood extent&nbsp;provided by P04, and WorldPop (2020) population data. The impact was assessed on the cumulated flooded areas basis. Summary tables are available at Downloads. <br/>

Since the 11 May 2019 a severe weather event, including heavy rainfall, strong winds and hailstorms have affected central and north-eastern regions of Italy, leading to river bank overflows that have resulted in much damage. The most affected area is the Emilia-Romagna Region. Heavy rainfall caused rapidly increasing levels of the Savio, Montone, Ronco, Panaro, Secchia, Sillaro and Foglia rivers, exceeding the highest alert level. In particular, the Secchia (Modena), Savio (Cesena), Sillaro (Imola) and Montone (Forlì) rivers have burst their banks.<br/>

The analysis employs five global multi-region multi-commodity models and covers selected combinations of socioeconomic storylines and climate signals by mid-century. Model inputs are harmonised by using the same projections for population and GDP growth, as well as relative biophysical crop yield changes due to climate change.

Activation date: 2021-08-24 <br/> 
Event type: Wildfire <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out over the municipality of Ezcaray in La Rioja region (North-Eastern Spain), started on the 21st August 2021 at about 13:20 (local time) and it was extinguished on the 23rd August. More than 100 hectares were affected in the Monte San Lorenzo, produced by two outbreaks in the Ezcaray area between Posadas and Az&aacute;rrulla.The goal of the activation is to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 78.98 ha burnt in the AOI, of which 5.15 ha only slightly damaged, 68.50 ha moderately damaged, and 5.33 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the main transportation network is characterised by unpaved cart tracks presumably serving the local agriculture, forestry, energy, and tourism industry. In terms of area, moors and heathland suffered the highest total damage, but they are also the two most common vegetation types in the AOI. Conversely, a small portion of the vegetation belongs to the broad-leaved forest, which was moderately damaged. The agricultural sector was not affected by the fire event and no damages were reported, as no arable lands occurred in the AOI. The fire ravaged inside an unpopulated area, therefore no inhabitants were affected by the event. <br/>

\r
Climate change is seen by Europeans as one of the world’s most serious problems, second only to poverty. Over half said they were fairly well informed about climate change but a large number said they still lacked information.\r
\r
When asked what should be done, a majority of Europeans thought that industry, governments, the public and the EU do not do enough to combat climate change. Three out of four primarily blamed industry.\r
\r
The survey shows that more and more Europeans are personally doing something to combat climate change, both in their personal consumption (sorting waste, reducing energy and water consumption at home, consuming fewer throw-away products, purchasing local and seasonal products) and their mode of transport. It is noted that more effort needs to be made in relation to renewable energy.\r

One last point to note: 44% of Europeans say they are ready to pay more to combat climate change."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """In spring 2008, the Commission and the European Parliament launched a major survey on the European public’s attitude to climate change (see EB 69.2). At the time, the Commission had just brought forward a set of proposals relating to that area, and Parliament had established its Temporary Committee on Climate Change.\r
\r
Now, one year later, the idea was to assess, via a new survey, the trends emerging within European public opinion. The survey would provide precise pointers in preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009.\r
\r
The two recently published EP/EBs (No 71) on the elections and on the financial crisis showed that Europeans are now primarily concerned about issues that directly affect their daily lives, such as unemployment, economic growth, inflation and purchasing power. On the other hand, there has been a clear decline in interest in collective issues of a global nature such as terrorism, immigration and climate change.\r
\r
This was confirmed by the findings of our latest survey."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The results of this second Eurobarometer dedicated to the 2009 European Elections should be read bearing in mind that the survey was conducted at the height of the economic and financial crisis in October and November 2008. A number of trends are highlighted: concerns of an economic and social nature, already amongst the principal preoccupations since the previous survey in spring in 2008 (EB69), show a large increase. Europeans are more and more preoccupied by their personal situation. On the contrary, concerns of a collective nature show a clear decline: terrorism, immigration and climate change. During the crisis, interest in the European elections is still limited.\r
\r
Campaign themes \r
The three main themes, which emerged during the last survey, show a large increase: economic growth (51%, +6), unemployment (49%, +2), inflation and purchasing power (47%, +6). On the other hand, preoccupations linked to collective concerns have fallen considerably: insecurity (33%, -4), the fight against climate change (29%, -4), immigration (29%, -3) and terrorism (28%, -7). \r
\r
\r
Level of interest and likelihood of voting in the European Elections from 4 to 7 June 2009 \r
Awareness of the election date is clearly increasing: A year ago, only 9% of Europeans cited the year 2009 (EB 68). Today this figure is 26%. However, due to the crisis, the interest of voting in the European elections is declining slightly (44% are "interested" while this figure was only 46% in the previous Eurobarometer), as well as the probability of voting. \r
\r
\r
Ties which unite Europeans \r
During the crisis, the Euro is the most important element of European identity at 40%*. The principal element which strengthens the sense of European citizenship is "a European social welfare system harmonized between the States" with 39%*. The results of this second survey on the European Parliament confirm that the general perception of the parliament by Europeans is positive: although still unknown, the institution is perceived as democratic and it is appreciated for its unifying role.

    dcterms:description """This is the first survey devoted to the European Parliament and it shows that it has a positive public image. Although the Parliament, like the other institutions, is not well known, it is considered democratic and is appreciated for its unifying role. Europeans award it an important place within the EU and the majority think the European Parliament is the institution that currently has the greatest decision-making power in the EU. They also think it is the institution that should have the greatest decision-making power.\r
\r
On the other hand, three out of four Europeans say that in general they are fairly badly or very badly informed about the European Parliament. This figure is almost the same in both ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States.\r
\r
For example, most Europeans do not know how many MEPs their country has and they believe that decisions are made primarily on the basis of MEPs’ national interests and not political affinities.\r
\r
Also three quarters of European citizens say they do not know when the next European elections will be held. Only 10% of respondents said ‘2009’ and only 2% could specify ‘June 2009’.\r
\r
Finally, the survey provides useful information on public expectations concerning the European Parliament. The policies EU citizens think should be given greatest priority are combating terrorism and climate change and improving consumer and public health protection.\r
\r
Europeans also expect the European Parliament give priority to protection of human rights in the world, equality between men and women, and solidarity between EU Member States."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This pre-electoral survey was carried out by TNS Opinion within the framework of the contract with the European Parliament as part of the invitation to tender for the "Electoral evening". In comparison to traditional EB/EP surveys also carried out by TNS Opinion for the Eurobarometer, the methodology differs: respondents aged 15 years and above have more face to face interviews for the EB/EP; respondents aged 18 years and above are interviewed by telephone in most countries, and face to face in countries where telephone coverage is not adequate for the pre-electoral survey. Therefore, the comparative results should be analysed bearing in mind these differences in methodology. However they allow us to identify the trends over a year and a half of the survey. Due to legal restrictions, the results related to Italy and Luxembourg will not be published. \r
\r
What are the main lessons which can be revealed in this survey ? \r
\r
An awareness which seems to be growing: at the beginning of May, when the survey was carried out, we note a clear increase in the intention to vote compared to the EB/EP survey of January/February, but there is no guarantee that the turnout rate will be equivalent to that of 2004: 45.47%. \r
\r
Better awareness of the date: presently, almost half of Europeans cite June 2009 as the election date. \r
\r
Interest in the elections is also increasing: more than half of Europeans claim to be interested in the next European elections. \r
\r
Image of the EP: more than half of Europeans have a positive image of the Institution; this proportion is increasing since January-February 2009. \r
\r
Campaign themes: again, unemployment and economic growth are the main issues which Europeans wish to see prioritised during this campaign. On the other hand, inflation and purchasing power which was in 3rd place during the previous two surveys is now in 5th place. """@en ;

\r
The turnout was 43%. However, this EU 27 average must be viewed in the light of the individual country results, which show a significant increase in turnout in eight countries, very little change in eight others and a very sharp fall in the 11 others.\r
\r
\r
The survey was again notable for highlighting the clear disparities in voting behaviour among social groups: fewer women vote than men, fewer young people than elderly people, fewer unemployed people than senior managers, fewer early school leavers than graduates, and slightly fewer city dwellers than inhabitants of rural areas.\r
\r
\r
67% of Europeans remembered having seen a television or print media campaign encouraging them to vote. There is no way of distinguishing between exposure to the European or to the various national campaigns to encourage people to vote in the European elections, but those campaigns did have some effect. At the same time, one third of voters who said they voted in national elections stated that they did not vote in European elections."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The results of this survey on the elections should be considered in the context of the current international situation. In fact, the survey's fieldwork (January/February) coincides with highly-charged international events: the inauguration of Barack Obama, the launch of his first recovery plan, the situation in Gaza, etc.\r
\r
There are a number of important trends to note:\r
\r
Campaign issues: unemployment is by far the campaign issue which Europeans wish to see tackled as a priority during the European electoral debate. This result confirms the enormous concern of Europeans in the face of the present situation and that which is to come, especially as regards their personal situation.\r
\r
\r
Level of awareness of the elections: the increase in awareness of the date is confirmed in comparison with the last two surveys. On the other hand, interest in the elections is not increasing and the likelihood of voting or not voting remains the same.\r
 The factors influencing the voter's choice in the election (candidates' experience both in the European and national domains, electoral program etc.) as well as the factors which cause them to abstain from voting are practically the same as those which were analysed in the EB/PE69 (Spring 2008).\r
\r
\r
The role of the EP: opinion is polarising gradually as we get closer to the election. Practically half of Europeans want to see it play a more important role while one sixth states the contrary. The number of "don't know" answers is decreasing.\r
\r
\r
Media recall of the EP: it is decreasing because of the international context as previously mentioned.\r
\r
\r
The EP and the expectations of European citizens:\r
\r
The demand for greater protection of the consumer and of public health as well as a better coordination of economic, budgetary and fiscal policies are the issues citizens most want to see addressed as a priority by the EP.\r
 As unemployment is the priority campaign issue, it is absolutely clear that it is the areas associated with the daily and personal life of Europeans which are paramount. This leads to a demand for greater protection at EU level in the face of a crisis, the end of which no-one currently knows.\r
 In parallel, we note from these results that the international role of the EU is perceived as less important for European citizens. There is currently an increase in those who would like the Union to address, as a priority, their everyday problems.\r
\r
\r
As regards values, the protection of human rights in the world is still in first place with a jump of 4 percentage points. The international context, marked by an intensification of certain conflicts and by increasing repression in many regions of the world, undoubtedly has a bearing on this.\r
 It is also presumably the reason why the defence of freedom of expression, evaluated for the first time, is found in 4th place (30%) of the values which the Parliament should defend as a priority."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """To mark Women's Day and in view of the European elections which will take place from 4 - 7 June 2009, two Eurobarometer surveys have been especially dedicated to the attitudes and concerns of women regarding the European Union. A sociodemographic analysis, commissioned by the EP analyses the cumulative results of the EB68, EB69 and EB70 Eurobarometer surveys (autumn 2007 - autumn 2008). The Eurobarometer Flash carried out at the request of the European Parliament and the European Commission focuses specifically on the female electorate on the eve of the 2009 European elections. \r
\r
\r
Sociodemographic analysis: Attitudes and opinions of European women on the eve of the 2009 European elections\r
\r
This sociodemographic analysis highlights to what extent women view their personal circumstances in a more negative manner than men. The statistics speak for themselves regarding the levels of employment, unemployment and annual income. It is not surprising that a significant percentage of women have a more reserved view of globalisation and show less support for the euro. They have less of a feeling of being listened to than men and they hold a less positive image of the EU. We note the same difference regarding their views on membership to the EU.\r
Women would like the European Parliament to prioritise consumer protection and public health. They see the issue of unemployment as the principal campaign theme which they would like to see address while men prioritise the debate on the economic crisis.\r
Finally, in the context of the European elections in June 2009, even if women say they are less interested than men in the European elections, their intention to vote is practically the same.\r
\r
\r
Eurobarometer Flash: Women and the European elections\r
\r
The Eurobarometer Flash contains questions which were posed to both men and women and questions which were posed only to women. Once again, the majority of women responded that their interests were not well represented by the EU. However, they do believe that the activities of the EP have an impact on life in general in the areas of education and the defence of the rights of women. In their eyes, the next Parliament should agree on the priority of equal salaries and the fight against violence and trafficking of women.\r
It is important to highlight that a significant majority of women do not feel discriminated against because of their gender.\r
In the political domain, a majority of women believe that politics is dominated by men. These last ones, to a lesser extent, also think this. If they want the proportion of women to be equal or surpass 50% in the EP, they do not want this objective to be achieved by the imposition of obligatory quotas. When choosing to vote for a candidate in the European elections, women say that they prioritise experience in European affairs. Men also prioritise this, but not as many.\r

    dcterms:description """This first, post-European elections standard "Parlemetre" functions as a primary post-electoral account of European citizens' perception of the European Parliament, and the image that the institution represents to them. In view of the 2014 elections, this survey acts equally to determine which of the policies defended by the European Parliament are perceived as priorities in the eyes of Europeans, and the values which the institution must defend in priority.\r
\r
To better understand the results, it is essential to remember that this survey was conducted in late January - mid February 2010. Thus, it was carried out prior to the considerable monetary pressures which are currently afflicting the EU.\r
\r
The reader should also note that it is necessary to take into account not only the overall results, but also those pertaining to each Member State, as there are considerable national variations for all questions.\r
\r
Europeans' media recall of the European Parliament is significantly increasing. It has risen from 42% at the end of 2007 to 62% today.\r
\r
\r
Although knowledge about the European Parliament is on the rise, respondents still have a limited knowledge about the institution's activities. This stands at 30% (+7 percentage points).\r
\r
\r
For Europeans, the Parliament should, as a matter of priority, defend policies to combat the crisis. Tackling poverty and social exclusion is the highest ranked policy priority, leading the way with a 44% European average. It is followed by consumer and public health protection (35%) and the fight against climate change (34%).\r
\r
\r
In terms of the values to be defended by the European Parliament, respondents accord by far the highest ranking to the protection of human rights (62%), followed by equality between men and women and freedom of speech (both 36%).\r
\r

Finally, a clear majority of Europeans (55%; +7) would like to see the Parliament play a more important role"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This European Parliament survey was carried out from 21 February 2011 to 6 March 2011 by TNS Opinion on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Women's day.\r
\r
This survey identifies several key points:\r
\r
First of all, the results show that, concerning all questions related to gender equality, men and women tend to react the same way. We can wonder whether this 100th anniversary of the International Women's Day should not be considered a real social step forward that contributes to tackle or reduce effectively the gender gap.\r
\r
\r
The averages at EU27 level must be completed by an analysis of national results that can sometimes turn out to be different.Â Unlike other surveys and common stereotypes relating to gender equality, we don't find regional or logical trends except in Nordic countries.\r
\r
\r
Another important point of this survey can be the fact that, among all measures to be taken to achieve equality between men and women, the Europeans favour encouraging measures rather than coercion.\r
\r
\r
Actually, in order to improve this situation, no matter what type of question, they give a lot of importance to encouraging measures rather than to coercion.\r
\r
Thus, coercion and encouraging measures reach 30 to 44% depending on the question. However, imposing quotas for women, either inside companies or on electoral lists during the different elections reaches 19% in both cases."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """On the initiative of the European Parliament, 2011 has been declared the ‘Year of Volunteering’, while 2012 will be the ‘Year of Intergenerational Solidarity’: two good reasons for the European Parliament to conduct a Eurobarometer survey in order to discover what Europeans think about these two concepts, and to understand better how they experience them or put them into practice.\r
\r
This Eurobarometer survey was conducted between 1 and 16 May 2011 by TNS opinion.\r
\r
Before analysing the responses from Europeans, it is necessary to emphasise some important points which can be drawn from this survey.\r
It is very difficult to reach general conclusions because of the different status of the voluntary sector in different Member States.\r
In the absence of Eurostat or other general statistics, the number of Europeans undertaking voluntary work cannot be quantified with any certainty.\r
The contribution of the voluntary sector to the GDP of the EU and its Member States is very difficult to estimate. No EU-wide statistics are available. National data are only available in a few countries.\r
There is a broad consensus that volunteering plays an important role in society, based on the values of solidarity. It contributes to citizenship, especially through the fact that it is well-established at a local level, and is a factor for personal fulfilment and development.\r
22 to 25% of Europeans are involved in voluntary work\r
Sport and culture: the main areas for voluntary work\r
Solidarity and humanitarian aid: the area in which the voluntary sector plays the most important role\r
Maintaining and strengthening social cohesion, the first benefit of volunteering in the EU\r
Defining an operating framework for the voluntary sector at national or EU level: a divided response.\r
Massive support for the creation of volunteer rescue teams in every region\r
- Encouraging intergenerational solidarity.\r

    dcterms:description """On the eve of the first European Council of 4 February 2011, devoted exclusively to energy, it became useful to measure the perception that Europeans have on the energy issue and on the respective roles of the European Union and its Member States in this area. \r
\r
Due to the dates of adoption of the different resolutions, this survey will be divided in two parts, the first one to be published before the European Council and the other one during the month of March. This latter will be focused on more specific questions related to the new EU energy strategy of 2020. \r
\r
As part of this first survey conducted by TNS Opinion, three general questions related to proposals made several times by the European Parliament, have been asked. The responses of the Europeans are very clear. \r
\r
On one hand, respondents are well aware of the European added value that a better coordination of energy policies, as well as greater solidarity between Member states in the event of a supply crisis, would allow. \r
\r
On the other hand, on energy priorities, the results show how the energy culture and the energy situation of each country of the EU, affect the nature of the answers. That's why we thought it important to include in this note a series of Eurostat statistics and maps ("Panorama of energy / edition 2009") which illustrate the energy context of each Member State. \r
\r
Which priority to reinforce the energy cooperation? \r
\r
Stability of energy prices, first priority of the respondents (29%) \r
\r
Renewable energies, second priority of the respondents (27%) \r

    dcterms:description """This Eurobarometer of the European Parliament dedicated to energy follows a previous survey published in January 2011 in view of the European Council of 4 February (EB Standard 74.3). This survey dealt with energy supply, cooperation and solidarity.\r
\r
Considering the new positions adopted by the European Parliament, this new survey focuses on more specific themes, but also extremely important for the development of an energy policy of the Union: energy savings, energy supply difficulties, integration of networks and the European Community for energy. The fieldwork was conducted by TNS Opinion between 9 February and 6 March 2011, in a context of a hard winter and an increase of all raw materials prices.\r
\r
it's important to note that both surveys share a common point: the results highlight again how the energy culture and the energy situation of each EU Member States influence the answers of the interviewed citizens.\r
\r
Two socio-demographic aspects of this current survey have to be kept in mind: on the one hand, apart from a few exceptions, there are few differences between the answers of men and women; on the other hand, the results illustrate a real generational gap which is evident in both behaviour and perception of the energy problems.\r
\r
On energy savings, European citizens prefer measures without a financial impact.\r
\r
The priority is given to domestic savings: decrease of use of lightings and of electric appliances (55%), and reduction of heating or air conditioning (43%). \r
\r
\r
The context is unfavourable to expensive measures: insulation of the house (19%) purchase of a more ecological car (6%). \r
\r
\r
The awareness related to savings made on the road is to be improved: less frequent use of their car (19%), more frequent use of public transport (14%) and reduction of driving speed (10%). \r
\r
\r
Europeans who did "nothing" to change their behaviour towards energy savings are a significant number (14%). \r
\r
\r
Respondents give the priority to practical measures to reduce the energy bill.\r
\r
They want to be able to daily measure their energy consumption thanks to "smart" meters (47%). \r
\r
\r
They expect the establishment of a tax incentive (40%). \r
\r
\r
They are in favour of the creation of conditions for energy providers to compete (36%). \r
\r
\r
They support the improvement of energy bill transparency and simplification (23%). \r
\r
\r
Europeans want the objective of 20% of energy savings to be made compulsory (80% of "yes").\r
\r
Europeans support the fighting against the energy precariousness (81% of "yes").\r
\r
Assets of a European integrated energy network\r
\r
It would imply a reduction of energy costs (59%). \r
\r
\r
It would encourage a better use of various types of energy (47%). \r
\r
\r
It would make the delivery of energy safer (35%). \r
\r
\r
It would enhance EU capacity to negotiate major contracts with countries outside its borders (28%). \r
\r
\r
It would contribute to increase solidarity among the EU Member States (25%). \r
\r
\r
Respondents show a massive support to the establishment of a European Energy Community (78% "agree")."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """On the eve of the European elections, it was important to measure Europeans' perceptions of the EU's actions in the face of the economic and financial crisis.\r
\r
This survey, conducted via face to face interviews with 27,218 EU citizens (fieldwork mid-January/mid-February), shows a collective concern to the crisis, a demand for more coordinated actions at an EU level and also by strikingly different national interpretations of the role of the euro. It also shows very clear variations on a socio-demographic level: women are more worried and more critical of the euro, along with citizens who left school at 15 years of age or before. There are a number of significant points to note:\r
\r
Europeans are very worried about the repercussions of the crisis.\r
This anxiety, which is felt very strongly in all countries (between 80 and 90%) affects all levels of the economy: global, European and national. This relates as much to the present situation as to the future. This anxiety is not as predominant at the personal level (58% today, 56% tomorrow).\r
\r
\r
Europeans are in favour of coordinated action to fight the crisis.\r
Their diagnosis is clear: 44% of them believe that Member States reacted in an individual manner, while 39% believe they acted in a coordinated manner.\r
On the other hand, 61% believe that Europeans would be better protected if the Member States adopted a coordinated approach. This kind of approach is urgently called for by the EP who has taken a stand to this effect on numerous occasions.\r
\r
\r
What is the most effective level at which to fight the crisis ?\r
This question stands out, even more than the others, due to the significant differences evident between Member States. This may be dependent on whether or not a country belongs to the G8 or on the extent of the seriousness of the economic crisis in their national territory. On average, 25% choose the G8 and 17% the EU, 15% say the USA and 14% cite the national government.\r
\r
\r
What actions should be taken at EU level ?\r
The European Parliament has repeatedly declared itself in favour of different measures at Union level. These are largely supported by Europeans in the percentage points which vary from 66 to 71%: coordination of economic and financial politics; supervision by the EU in cases where public money is used to rescue financial institutions; surveillance of the activities of the most important international financial groups; the role of the EU at international level in regulating financial services.\r
\r
\r
The euro: a protector ?\r
This question on the role of the euro in mitigating the negative effects of the crisis was posed in all of the member countries of the Union. Among the twenty-seven Member States, 44% of Europeans think that the euro has not mitigated the crisis as opposed to 39% who think that it has effectively mitigated this crisis, 17% did not know.\r
Indeed, the results show that the perception of the euro varies considerably from one country to another. The detailed table (see p. 15 of the summary) shows that 17 countries responded positively to the question, among which 13 are countries in the euro zone, 3 are countries which are obliged to adopt it and 1 country which refused to adopt it.\r
\r
\r
The former national currency would have been as effective a protector as the euro ?\r
45% of citizens in the euro zone answered no, while another 45% of them answered yes. This average conceals significant disparities between Member States in the euro zone as in twelve of the sixteen countries, a majority does not agree with this statement."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This survey of Europeans and the crisis is the second one instigated by the European Parliament. The first took place in January/February 2009, preceding the European elections of June 2009.\r
\r
Between the two European Parliament enquiries, the European Union launched various initiatives aimed at fighting the crisis: regulations, a European monetary fund, economic governance, 2020 strategy, etc. The Parliament has taken stances on some of these, or is about to, through various global reports.\r
\r
At the same time, Member States have launched deep budgetary reforms aimed at reducing public deficits.\r
\r
It is in this context that Europeans were questioned about their concerns relating to the crisis: How they perceive the responses of the EU and the Member States? What they think about solidarity between Member States? Which actors are most able to combat the crisis? What priority policies should be decided today at EU level? What next for the EU in 2020? etc.\r
\r
27 218 citizens were interviewed face-to-face by TNS Opinion. The results confirmed the great worries of Europeans in the face of the crisis - concerns which were already evident in the former Eurobarometer. The main findings are as follows:\r
\r
Europeans would clearly like the EU and its Member States to act in a more coordinated way, but less so than they did in January 2009.\r
\r
\r
They clearly want Member States to be more active in dealing with the crisis.\r
\r
\r
In the light of a widespread feeling that poverty is rising, European citizens want the EU's policies to be developed with a focus on protecting them directly: tackling poverty and exclusion, improving consumer protection etc. They are more in favour of these individual-oriented policies than global issues, such as climate change.\r
\r
\r
There is a divided opinion on which kind of measures should be taken to end the crisis: Which is the better route: austerity or economy-boosting measures?\r
\r
\r
Respondents showed massive support for financial regulation and measures to control the banking system. \r
\r
\r
They showed clear support for financial solidarity with EU Member States in difficult economic situations.\r
\r
\r
Respondents support a convergence of the economic, fiscal and financial policies of all Member States.\r
\r
\r
A significant amount of Europeans found themselves unable to give a definite answer to economic questions on a large scale (national, global etc.). This reflects their sensitivity to the uncertainties of finding a solution to the crisis.\r
\r
\r
The results also displayed national trends in line with the Member States' domestic situations (which vary greatly). It should be remembered that the EU average is weighted according to demographic and population criteria.\r
\r
\r
Results also showed uncertainty as to the effectiveness of the euro to fight the crisis.\r

    dcterms:description """This Eurobarometer survey on "Europeans and the crisis" is the third such survey realised by the European Parliament.\r
\r
The first one was carried out in January-February 2009, six months before the European elections, while the second was conducted in September 2010. The fieldwork for this survey was carried out by TNS opinion between 13 April and 2 May 2011 on the basis of face-to-face interviews with 26 825 European citizens.\r
\r
In the seven months since the previous survey, the national and international context has been marked by several major events which have undoubtedly played an important role in shaping the answers of Europeans to the questions posed.\r
\r
In-between, public opinion at EU level has moved only marginally, whereas there were major shifts between the first and second surveys (January - August 2010). It should be borne in mind that the six most populous Member States account for approximately 70% of the EU 27 average.\r
\r
Before analysing the results of this survey in detail, it is worth highlighting the main findings:\r
\r
Europeans are strongly in favour of the principle of a tax on financial transactions at global level, or failing that at EU level initially.\r
\r
\r
A majority of Europeans believe that overall the euro has not mitigated the effects of the crisis.\r
\r
\r
To combat the crisis, a majority of Europeans above all want the Member States to act in a more coordinated way.\r
\r
\r
In the debate on whether to boost the economy or reduce public spending, we note that the economic situation of the Member States has a direct impact on answers. In seven months, they have sometimes varied by between 10 and 38 points.\r
\r
\r
Tackling exclusion and poverty is still the first political priority of Europeans, although there have been very significant variations in several Member States between the two surveys.\r
\r
\r
Food security: helping agriculture in developing countries seems to be the most effective measure to the respondents, followed by combating speculation on food products. In terms of objectives, Europeans strongly support several measures of which ensuring that everyone has access to food products at affordable prices and also that farmers have a fair income."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """This EB/PE survey "Europeans and the crisis" was conducted by TNS Opinion between 3rd and 18th September 2011 on the basis of face to face interviews with 26.856 citizens aged over 15. The previous one was carried out in April-May 2011.\r
\r
On the question of financial solidarity between Member States, there is a trend to a kind of polarization of the public opinion: the number of respondents who "do not know" decreased between the two surveys, in favour of negative answers. \r
\r
\r
Credit rating agencies (CRA):\r
\r
The media coverage of the debates on the credit rating agencies (CRA) in the political, economic and financial world can explain that one European out of two (50%) has already heard about the CRA. Amongst those, a majority (65%) are in favour of the creation of a European credit rating agency.\r
\r
Euro:\r
\r
6 months ago, 57% of the Europeans found that "euro has mitigated the negative effects of the current crisis", they are now 54% (-3).\r
The percentage of those who think that "the euro has mitigated the negative effects of the current crisis" has not changed: 34%.\r
\r
\r
Share a part of the Public debt:\r
\r
When asked about the idea to share a part of the sovereign debt, most of the Europeans are in favour of this option although the differences between Member States can reach 39 percentage points on some items.\r
\r
Eurobonds:\r
\r
The last months were marked by an emerging debate on Eurobonds within the Euro zone. \r
\r
A first question "Have you ever heard of Eurobonds?" has been asked in all the Member States: 57% of Europeans answered no whereas 42% answered that they already have heard of Eurobonds (46% for the Euro zone; 35% for the non-Euro zone).\r
\r
\r
A second question has been raised to the 46% of the respondents of the Euro zone who said that they have already heard of Eurobonds, to know if they "are in favour or opposed to the creation of Eurobonds": 38%are in favour, 33% are against.\r

It brought together the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the Members of the Economic and Social Committee (EESC), and Representatives of NGOs, who represented the organised civil society.\r
\r
In this framework, for the first time, a consensus conference, in which European citizens in situation of precariousness participated, helped the non organised civil society to make it heard.\r
\r
For this purpose, groups of citizens gathered in two-thirds of the Member States in order to debate on their personal situation in this period of economic, social and financial crisis. One or more participants per countries were invited in Brussels on 26, 27 and 28 January. This consensus conference allowed them to share their personal experiences and to express recommendations for other parties interested in Agora.\r

    dcterms:description """Seventy-two percent (72%) of respondents say they do not feel informed about the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Ombudsman, the other EU institutions, and the European Network of Ombudsmen clearly have a major role to play in informing citizens better about the Charter.\r
\r
Almost half of the respondents consider the right to move and reside freely in the EU to be the most important citizens' right. The second most important citizens' right, according to the respondents, is the right to good administration, followed by the right to lodge complaints with the Ombudsman. This result is very encouraging for the Ombudsman's efforts to strengthen his visibility in order to help citizens make use of their right to good administration.\r
\r
Satisfaction with the EU administration is generally low when it comes to its effectiveness, service-mindedness, and transparency. It is particularly worrying that the EU is felt to perform worst on transparency (42% say they are not satisfied with the level of transparency in the EU administration). As one third of the Ombudsman's inquiries concern lack of transparency, this result reinforces his determination to help the EU institutions become more open, effective, and citizen friendly.\r
\r
A majority of respondents (52%) thinks that the Ombudsman’s most important function is to ensure that EU citizens know their rights and how to use them. 34% of respondents think that it is important for the European Ombudsman to work with ombudsmen in the different EU Member States, while seeking redress for complainants in cases of maladministration is regarded as important by only 27% of respondents. These results underline the importance of the Ombudsman's communication policy vis-à-vis European citizens and the need for close cooperation within the European Network of Ombudsmen. However, the European Ombudsman also has to reinforce his information policy as regards his main task of dealing with complaints, especially towards potential complainants such as companies, NGOs, associations, organisations, and others.\r
\r
Roughly half of respondents would like to know more about what the Ombudsman does. This result underlines the importance of the Ombudsman's efforts to inform the broader public about his services. It also stresses the need for targeted information to those citizens, companies, and other stakeholders who might actually need the services of the Ombudsman at some point in the future."""@en ;

<http://data.europa.eu/88u/dataset/2012-crisis-and-economic-governance-v> a dcat:Dataset ;
    dcterms:description """This Eurobarometer survey on ‘The crisis and the economic governance in Europe is the fifth carried out by the European Parliament. It was conducted by TNS opinion between 10 and 25 March 2012, in face-to-face interviews with 26 593 Europeans aged 15 and over.\r
\r
Prior to key meetings of heads of state and government on the theme of the crisis, most Europeans think that the EU has to take action to reduce public spending and boost economic growth at the same time (47%) 25 % of Europeans consider that priority must be given to measures that stimulate the economy, and 23 % are in favour of measures to reduce public spending.\r
\r
The survey’s findings confirm a known trend which shows a polarisation of public opinion. Indeed, the number of people who do not have any opinion decreases from survey to survey.\r
\r
Although the primary focus of the current debate between the Member States is whether or not to they should take action together, 55 % of Europeans (=) would feel better protected by measures adopted in a coordinated way with the other EU countries, while 38% (+3) of them are in favour of individual measures.\r
\r
As far as the ways of tackling the crisis are concerned, there are clear differences between those inside the euro zone (61% in favour of coordination) and those outside it (43%). \r
\r
Although they are in favour of solidarity, most Europeans consider that financial help for Member States in economic or financial difficulties must be made conditional on compliance with common rules (80%). They also believe that penalties should be imposed when these rules are broken (72%).\r
\r
Concerning budgetary issues, some 65 % (-2) of those surveyed are in favour of preliminary consultations between European and national institutions whilst national budgets are being drawn up. Once again, there is a very big difference between those inside the euro zone (70%) and those outside it (56%) .\r
\r
On the financial transaction tax (FTT) we observe, as for the other questions, a clear change in the opinion between the two surveys. Henceforth 66% of Europeans (+5) are in favour of the principle of a financial transaction tax, 73% in the euro zone and 53% in the non euro zone, a difference of 20 percentage points. \r
\r
Always during these six months, we note a growing awareness of Eurobonds. Today, nearly one European in two (49 %; +7) has heard of Eurobonds. This awareness is greater inside the euro zone (53 %) than outside it (42 %). \r
\r
Although most of Europeans are in favour of pooling part of the public debt of Member States, their analysis differs on the impact that this may have.\r
\r
Awareness of the credit rating agencies (CRA) has also increased: 13 countries had their ratings downgraded by CRAs in the last six months. It is therefore no surprise to discover that 61 % (+11) of Europeans have heard of CRAs. Asked whether an independent European CRA should be created to counterbalance the power of the existing agencies, 67 % (+2) of Europeans were in favour. Finally, 54 % of Europeans think that in serious crisis, the CRAs should not rate countries which have been helped by other EU Member States."""@en ;

\r
In this light, the DG Communication of the European Parliament has commissioned a desk research to analyse the electoral behaviour of voters and abstainees. This was based on the 2014 post-election survey of 27,331 Europeans over the age of 18 (16 in Austria). The survey by TNS Opinion was carried out a few days after the vote, between 30 May and 27 June 2014. \r
\r
The aim of this research work is to identify the profiles of abstainees and voters, and to understand the reasons underlying their decision to vote or abstain, and to analyse their attitudes and opinions regarding the EU. \r
\r
In addition, it includes 2 national factsheets for each Member State, dedicated to voters and abstainees. For Belgium, Luxembourg (compulsory vote for both countries) and Malta (high level of turnout) the factsheet on the abstainees is not available due to the low number of abstainees. """@en ;

In compliance with the Paris Agreement commitments, the countries in Clima-Med have prepared their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and a growing number of South Mediterranean cities have already committed to take climate action initiatives through the development of local climate actions setting targets of at least the applicable NDC. Since 2012 the JRC has been supporting the implementation of the local climate plans in the MENA region and the present report aims to help the municipalities in setting their GHG emissions targets for 2030. Cities are requested to set their targets against a projected “business as usual” (BAU) trajectory, a reference case that represents future conditions most likely to occur in the absence of measures to control the GHG emissions. In this context, JRC has developed a methodology to estimate the GHG emissions in 2030 based on the national BAU projection reported in the NDCs. In practice, a set of national BAU coefficients (KNDC-BAU) has been calculated to enable the cities calculating the maximum GHG emissions allowed in the target year (2030). The methodology NDC-based does not apply to Algeria and Egypt and for those last countries it was used the 2020 GECO reference scenario.

Many regions have been affected but mostly the Notranjska region in the south-western part of the country. State of emergency was proclaimed for the whole country on 2 February 2014. Extreme weather conditions have caused extensive power cuts with more than 80,000 client sites affected, leaving around 250,000 people without electric power. From Thursday, 6th February temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius caused fast sleet and snow melting which along with tree debris in the water and rain has led to flooding in several parts of Slovenia, especially in the south-western part. High water levels are expected to cover almost all karst fields at the southwest and middle part of Slovenia in the following days.<br/>

    dcterms:description "Employing an economy-wide model (JRC DEMETRA), the analysis provides a detailed characterization of the AfCFTA impacts on the Kenyan economy in the 2021-2035 timeframe. It considers two liberalization scenarios — tariff-only liberalization and tariff&Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) liberalization — across four potential liberalization schedules defined by alternative government revenue, food security and economic development objectives. To capture the responses to the AfCFTA establishment occurring outside Kenya, results from a continental-level assessment are linked to the DEMETRA model to determine changes in international markets. The study findings show that the tariff-only liberalization leads to moderate positive outcomes, encouraging trade in commodities where Kenya already has a comparative advantage, namely cash crops. Moreover, there is a decrease in the production of food crops which are substituted by their imported variety signalling an increase in import dependency in this area. The tariff&NTMs liberalization induces a more significant reduction in trade costs thus stimulating trade. Exports of cash crops continue to have the highest expansion rate followed by manufacturing products. At the same time, there is an important growth of imports in manufacturing and processed food, which determines the output of many activities in this area to reduce relative to baseline values.

About 10000 original lists corresponding with some 1 200 000 data representative of the former distribution of vascular plant species in Belgium, were digitised. The IFBL data is integrated in existing national and regional flora databases and will contribute to the realisation of regional Flora Atlases. The analysis of the digitised data will improve the possibilities to compare floral data over successive periods and will be of help in developing a strategy for reducing the costs and the length of new flora monitoring and mapping projects in the future.
The Atlas of the Flora (Pteridophytes – Spermatophytes) of Belgium and Luxemburg (Van Rompaey & Delvosalle 1972) was the result of the first national flora mapping project (1939- 1971). Unfortunately, the data used to build it were only digitised at a synthetic level (units of 16 km²). To be able to investigate the changes in the flora between the first mapping period and the second (1972 up to now) in all its aspects, especially in relation to environmental factors (climatic, pollution, land use…), the original data was digitized, i.e. the field records on the flora (flora checklists) made within 1km² IFBL squares."""@en ;

This is an exceptional activation of the Risk and Recovery Mapping Service as the analysis does not represent the actual risk assessment, but has been defined by the needs of an exercise planned on 1 April 2020 by the fire-brigade and civil protection command team of the German city of Herne.The simulated scenario consists of a flooding event occurred in Herne due to high water levels of the Emscher river, caused by heavy rainfall over the German cities of Dortmund and Castrop-Rauxel. The southern through wall of the Emscher is damaged at the point: 51.551 N 7.140 E, and breaks at 08.00 a.m. This moment will be considered as the starting point for the exercise. Parts of Herne are instantaneously flooded. Particularly, all areas below 40 m a.s.l may be fully flooded. On the contrary, the northern areas with respect to the Emscher river remain unaffected.The aim of this CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard activation is to provide the fire-brigade and civil protection command team of the German city of Herne with the modelled flood extent (i.e. P05 - Modelled Flood extent for major events) to be used during the planned exercise.Proposed solution and resultsFigure 1 shows the Modelled flood extent for major events map obtained from the hydraulic modelling, while Figure 2 shows a zoom of the position in which the breakage of the banks is assumed. The maximum water depth estimated for the AOI is 6.5m.Figure 1: modelled flood overview.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Figure 2:&nbsp;zoom on location of the rupture of the weir. <br/>

Because of their quick response to local and regional changes in environmental conditions, they are sensitive indicators of ongoing processes. Many users of these freshwater bodies need (or need to develop) a certain ecological quality. To optimize the ecological function of lentic freshwater systems a good understanding of their condition and occurring changes is needed and a specific reference situation is required. A classification that leans on a broad ecological base is essential. To have, in the future, a more objective and effective way to perform nature conservation, to prioritize nature development ect, we need to map the different types of freshwater bodies. We also need more knowledge related to environmental circumstances who can secure sustainable development of aquatic communities. The main objective of this study include the simplification of the main variety of permanent lentic freshwater systems in Flanders into workable units for environmental assessment, management and planning. A hierarchic typology will be worked out, based on biotic and ecological characteristics of key factors. The data collected in this context they are also important for determining the ongoing ecological status of still waters and to develop specific targets and a pragmatic evaluation method."@en ;

Activation date: 2016-06-13 <br/> 
Event type: Other <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
Two areas of Special Areas of Conservation: Sierra de Espad&aacute;n and Curs Alt del riu Millars were hit by a forest fire in July 2015, in the Mont&aacute;n and Caudiel municipalities of the region of Valencia. The analysis of the damage degree and landslide and erosion risk is of key importance for the spatial and temporal planning of the post-event restoration work. The scope of the activation included:Delineation/gradingDelineation by a combination of semi-automatic thresholding of post event VHR optical satellite image data and visual interpretation of UAV images.A combination of vegetation index (NDVI and MSAVI) with burn index (BAI) and statistical measures to differentiate the damage severity.Loss assessmentThe loss of biodiversity is based on the environmental value of the area, estimated from biotic (flora and fauna) and abiotic (hydrology, slope, geology, shade, etc.) elements, which render an area more or less suitable for feeding, nesting, etc. For the habitats identification, the Spanish Inventory of Land Habitats (MAGRAMA, 1997) and the Spanish Natural and Semi-natural Habitats (MAGRAMA, 2005) were used. This was combined with the fire damage grade to assess and quantify biodiversity loss.The estimated total biomass prior to the fire was based on the structure and development of the forest stand, given by land use/cover data and the Spain Forest Map MAGRAMA, MFE50. For every type of predominant forest a combustion factor was assigned, taking into consideration the severity of the fire, thereby obtaining the total biomass after the fire.Landslide riskComputed using Spatial Multicriteria Evaluation technique (SMCE), based on the European Landslide Susceptibility Map (ELSUS1000) Version 1 methodology, a factor of slope gradient, land cover and lithology.Erosion riskEvaluated in terms of average of loss of soil based on Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). This is a function of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and gradient, vegetation cover and anti-erosion measures.Mitigation measuresRemoval of burnt wood and soil protection with plant materialReforestation of burnt areasHydrotechnicsBank stabilizationDykes&nbsp; <br/>

The dataset includes over 60 fish species, as well as a number of non-target crustacean species. The data are retrieved from the Fish Information System (VIS), a database set up to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders and are collected in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, certain red lists, and biodiversity research. The VIS database is described in Brosens et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.475.8556). Additional information, such as measurements, absence information and abiotic data are available upon request. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/vis-estuarine-monitoring-events

Length and weight measurement data of the individual fishes, absence information, occurrence data since 2015, as well as abiotic data of the sampling points (pH, temperature, etc.) are not included in the Darwin Core Archive and are available upon request.

    dcterms:description "The Belgian Coccinellidae dataset which is published, is the result of a merge of 4 datasets. The INBO (Research Institute for Nature and Forest; Flemish Region Database), the DFF database (The Walloon Region Database), Observations.be data provided by Natagora (The Walloon Region and Brussels Capital Region) and the Walloon Region Online Encoding Tool (DEMNA - OFFH, observatoire.biodiversite.wallonie.be/encodage) data. At present, the database contains about 80.000 records, of which 15% come from museum collections and literature data. Collection events minimally consist of species, number of individuals, stage (adults, larvae and pupae), observation date, observer and location. Original locations as well as collection material were attributed to 1x1 km or 5x5 km grid cells of the UTM grid (Universal Transverse Mercator). A large part of the Belgian territory has been surveyed for ladybird beetles: the database contains records for at least 85% of all 5x5km UTM grid cells (N = 1376) in Belgium. Additionally, data on substratum plants, height in the vegetation, sampling method, habitat type, surrounding landscape, slope orientation, soil type, humidity, vegetation cover and behaviour were noted. In 1999, the Belgian Ladybird Working Group Coccinula launched a large scale field survey on 40 native ladybird species (Coccinellinae, Chilocorinae and Epilachninae) and to date has more than 500 volunteers providing distribution data. They actively search for ladybird beetles in a variety of habitats using sweep nets, beating trays, visual search, light trapping, pitfall traps and other sampling methods. Distribution, habitat and substrate plant information is also noted on a standard recording form. The working group maintains a database of observations, literature and collection data of Coccinellidae from 1800 onwards. Preliminary atlases have been published for the whole Belgian territory (Branquart et al., 1999; Adriaens and Maes, 2004) and updated distribution maps are available online, on demand and through the working group's newsletter. The published dataset contains most of the data maintained by the working group. For the time being, only the original INBO database is published."@en ;

    dcterms:description """The Survey of Schools: ICT in Education, published in March 2019, builds upon the European Commission’s [first Survey of Schools: ICT in Education](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/survey-schools-ict-education).The survey was conducted in a partnership between Deloitte and IPSOS, on behalf of the European Commission.\r
\r
The 2nd Survey of Schools: ICT in Education has two objectives:\r
\r
Objective 1: Benchmark progress in ICT in schools - to provide detailed and up-to-date information related to access, use and attitudes towards the use of technology in education by surveying head teachers, teachers, students and parents covering the EU28, Norway, Iceland and Turkey;\r
\r
Objective 2: Model for a ‘highly equipped and connected classroom’ - to define a conceptual model for a  ‘highly equipped and connected classroom’ (HECC), presenting three scenarios to describe different levels of a HECC and to estimate the overall costs to equip and connect an average EU classroom with advanced components of the HECC model.\r
\r
- The entry level scenario outlines the minimum and essential components of a HECC.\r
- The advanced scenario further advances the entry level scenario, e.g. by entailing more advanced digital equipment, as well as a greater number of teachers’ professional development activities and access to paid-for contents.\r
- The cutting-edge level is a further advanced scenario in relation to network requirements, it also includes a greater variety of digital equipment and increased opportunities for face-to-face professional development for teachers, and leadership training.\r
\r
\r
The survey was carried out in 31 countries (EU28, Norway, Iceland and Turkey), by conducting interviews with head teachers, teachers, students and parents (ISCED level 1: primary schools: ISCED level 2: lower secondary schools; ISCED level 3: upper secondary schools). A range of different topics was covered, including:\r
\r
- Access to and use of digital technologies\r
- Digital activities and digital confidence of teachers and students\r
- ICT related teacher professional development\r
- Digital home environment of students\r
- Schools’ digital policies, strategies and opinions\r

    dcterms:description """An inventory was made of the alien macroinvertebrates occurring in Flanders. To this end large collections of biological samples were investigated and supplemented with own sampling campaigns. Mainly fresh and brackish surface waters were investigated. Three new macroinvertebrate species for Flanders were discovered. In total 41 alien macroinvertebrates were encountered in fresh and slightly brackish surface waters in Flanders. Additionally, 24 alien macroinvertebrate species have been reported for the Belgian part of the North Sea and its adjacent estuaries. Most alien macroinvertebrates belonged to the crustaceans and molluscs. Over 2,500 samples containing macrocrustaceans were identified to species level, which allowed us to accurately map their distribution in Flanders. Alien species found in the fresh and brackish water environment, mainly originated from the Ponto-Caspian area and North-America followed by Asia and South- and East-Europe. This overview shows that alien macroinvertebrates are widespread and abundantly present in many watercourses in Flanders. Based on observations in neighbouring countries, several additional species are expected to arrive in the near future. A follow-up of the invasive alien species together with a monitoring scheme to detect new incoming species is valuable to estimate the size of the problem and to be able to closely follow their ecological and economic impact

This dataset was originally created for research on the spread and impact of alien invasive macroinvertebrate species in Flanders. However, the dataset can be reused for a variety of purposes. However, this being an occurrence dataset, it can be used for understanding species richness, distribution pattern and modelling studies such as ecological niche modelling. In order to enhance the confidence of use, we have documented the metadata as well as subjected the data records to a series of quality assessment and enhancement processes as described in the earlier section quality control description.

    dcterms:description """A simplified balance sheet to estimate apparent consumption of meat, crops and dairy products, olive oil and wine, at Member State level. It combines trade data from Eurostat COMEXT database and DG AGRI's short-term outlook for EU agricultural markets to provide historic data on agricultural production, trade and an estimate of apparent use.

DG AGRI, in the Short-term outlook, prepares regularly EU balance sheets for the main agricultural commodities, as well as production, area and yield figures at Member State level, but an estimate of Member States annual consumption was missing, since Eurostat stopped collecting and publishing balance sheets. This dataset fills partially the gap with a rough estimate of apparent use, without detailing the different uses (food, feed, processing), losses or changes in stocks. This apparent use cannot be taken at face value as the consumption level, also because the calculation relies on trade statistics between EU Member States which are less reliable than extra-EU trade figures.

The dataset is updated 3 times per year, at every new release of the DG AGRI Short-term outlook.

The dataset is accompanied by an interactive dashboard, which allows a wide exploration of data. A set of graphs and charts is displayed according to countries, years and products selected by the user. The tool is not only thought to provide average trends, but also to answer specific ad hoc questions on a particular Member State.

User feedback is always welcome to further improve our dashboard. Please write to JRC-DATAM@ec.europa.eu"""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Waarnemingen.be - Plant occurrences in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium is a species occurrence dataset published by Natuurpunt and described (v1.4) in Steeman et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925). The dataset contains over 2.3 million plant occurrences of almost 1,300 naturally occurring species (native, vagrant or migrant species), recorded by volunteers (citizen scientists), mainly since 2008. Together with the datasets Van Landuyt & Brosens (2017, http://www.gbif.org/dataset/271c444f-f8d8-4986-b748-e7367755c0c1) and Van Landuyt & Noé (2015, https://doi.org/10.15468/xnlbke), the dataset represents the most complete overview of indigenous plants in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region (north Belgium). The occurrences are derived from the database http://www.waarnemingen.be, hosted at the nature conservation NGO Natuurpunt in collaboration with Stichting Natuurinformatie. Standardized information regarding the occurrence's sex, reproductiveCondition, behavior, occurrenceRemarks, and samplingProtocol is included as well.

Among these, there is a lack of preclinical animal models capable of mimicking patient conditions and predicting responses to new therapies. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop more comprehensive, functional non-animal models.
The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) has carried out an extensive review of advanced non-animal models being used for basic and applied research into immuno-oncology. Researchers characterised and catalogued 542 models to make them more accessible for human relevant studies that avoid the use of animals.

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard has been activated by EEAS (European External Action Service) on behalf of the World Bank Group in order to support EU Delegation, World Bank, UN and AfDB in a Recovery and Peace Building Assessment. This aims at understanding causes of the conflict in the North of Mozambique, and at developing a strategy for future Government&rsquo;s intervention in the area. The ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province started in October 2017 with attacks by insurgents. The attacks have since escalated and gained in range and sophistication. Thousands of people have died and hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced.The goal of the activation was to support the RPBA through the monitoring of the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps within ten AOIs in Cabo Delgado Province, to analyse their status and composition, and to focus on the land use land cover changes before and after the camps settlement.The P03.5-LULC: CLC @1:25000 (NEW) and P03.2-LULC: CLC @1:25000 (UPDATE) products provide the land use land cover map created by using pre- or post-event VHR optical images and replicating the Corine Land Cover (CLC) model.Detail of P03.5 (pre-event) LULC in AOI04-Nanjua-B.

The scope of the service request was to carry out a pre‐disaster Forest Fire Risk assessment in two areas near Split and Dubrovnik in Croatia. Apart from the General Reference context the following Risk and Recovery products were generated:Forest Fire exposure and risk, as well as vulnerability of people and assetsRisk - specific mitigation measures suggestionsCritical information for the development and management of first response infrastructuresAssets &amp; Population Exposure &amp; VulnerabilityThe assessment of the forest fire&nbsp;hazard&nbsp;accounts for fire intensity and surface properties. The generation of a forest fire index layer was based on specific assumptions and accounts for anaglyph, aspect &amp; height zones, vegetation cover, climatological conditions and historical forest fires records. Forest fires hazard maps show the hazard levels in forest and semi natural areas, as well as some heterogeneous agricultural areas. The urban environment and arable land areas are excluded from the forest fire hazard assessment.To illustrate the&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;of assets and population, transportation network, POIs, LULC, and population (low &amp; high season), information was overlaid on to the forest fire hazard layer, while the assessment of the exposed elements&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;accounts for specific criteria that characterize fire vulnerability through distinguishing urban from non-urban areas.Transportation Network Vulnerability to DisruptionVulnerability of disruption&nbsp;accounts for the following parameters:Road capacity, inferred by the respective taxonomy (primary, secondary, etc.)Proximity to populated placesPopulation (residents), distinguishing two seasons (High-touristic &amp; Low)The accentuated relief imposes the development of the road network along and near the coastline and results in high disruption vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population, Assets &amp; Transportation Network at RiskForest fire risk estimation depends on the type of biomass fuel and the proximity of population and assets to the most hazardous areas in terms of forest fire activity. Transport network risk is estimated as the combined effect of hazard and vulnerability to disruption.The first aid areas and appropriate mitigation measures information, aim to provide elaborated proposals for efficiently addressing civil protection and response efforts.&nbsp; <br/>

Emissions from large scale biomass burning with Savannah burning, forest fires, and sources and sinks from land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) are excluded.

For the energy related sectors the activity data are mainly based on the energy balance statistics of IEA (2017) (Internet: http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2017_co2_fuel-2017-en), whereas the activity data for the agricultural sectors originate mainly from FAO (2018) (Internet: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home). Additional information can be found in Crippa et al. (2019).

Novelties compared to previous EDGAR release (EDGARv4.3.2 (Crippa et al., 2018)) are: - new temporal profiles to compute monthly and hourly emissions (Crippa et al., 2020, in press),
 - new spatial proxies to distribute population-related emissions based on the Global Human Settlements Layer product (Pesaresi et al., 2019),
 - updates in the technologies, emission factors and end-of-pipe reductions for the power generation sector (for Europe, China and USA) based on the Platts 2018 database, and the implementation of the regulation taking place in these regions,

The collection adds to the previously published EURL ECVAM Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Consolidated Database of Ames positive substances (https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/jrc-eurl-ecvam-genotoxicity-carcinogenicity-ames) that has become, over the years, a reference for a number of activities in the area of genotoxicity testing across different product-type sectors, including regulatory initiatives, exploratory projects, development of testing strategies, and validation of new genotoxicity tests. 
Detailed information on the data and construction of the database are reported in Madia et al. 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mrgentox.2020.503199, recently published in Mutation Research - Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis journal.

Recently, a project was begun to database the entire collection. To date over 20,000 specimens have been processed and we estimate that the total collection presently surpasses 100,000 specimens. The collection’s geographic focus is Kenya with additional Afrotropical material. 
The taxon dimension of the collection is primarily Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera/Homoptera  and the geographic dimension of those groups is predominantly from Kenya. The collection is an actively developing one and some of the research on the collection includes the PINDIP (Pollinator Information Network for Two-Winged Insects) (link to: https://www.pindip.org/) project.

Tropical Cyclone MANGKHUT-18 is gaining strength and will strike Guam and parts of the Northern Mariana Islands

Conditions are generally favorable for intensification, including low wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures, 
and Mangkhut is expected to become the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane as it rakes through the islands.
The peak winds are expected Monday afternoon and evening near the track of the center of Mangkhut,

Activation reason: <br/> 
The Australian continent continues to experience a prolonged rainfall event associated with the current La Nina event. This ongoing weather pattern has now impacted New South Wales where a number of the communities within the area are again experiencing severe flooding. Continued and extensive rainfall has led to more flooding in already saturated catchments which is expected to continue, as warned by the National Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). The activation of Copernicus Emergency Management Service is meant to fill a critical gap in the situational awareness of the event, through the use of a cloud penetrating radar capability to acquire the areas of interest, which are expected to be covered by thick clouds in the coming days.

Activation reason: <br/> 
The current activation addressed the forest fire that took place on 6 August 2015, in the municipality of Acebo, C&aacute;ceres, Spain, and burned approximately 8,160 ha of pine trees and shrub land. It aims to evaluate the recovery of forests in terms of reduced soil erosion and the recovery of the flora.The RRM products calculate and compare the situation just before the event (2014 and&nbsp;2015), after the event (2015 post and 2016), after the restoration activities finished (2016), and annually after that moment (2017, 2018 and 2019).Vegetation recoveryVegetation recovery&nbsp;of the years 2016 and 2019, with respect to the pre-event situation in 2014-2015, was assessed in respect of two variables: spectral recovery and vegetation height.Biodiversity recovery has been assessed by detecting the changes observed between 2015-2019. Results describe the pre-fire conditions, grading the change direction and the current status of the vegetation.Soil loss assessmentThe analysis allowed for an assessment of observed soil loss quantifying the loss of soil after the event, compared with the pre-event conditions.Ground deformationAssessment of ground deformation shows patterns of estimated ground deformation in the area of interest after decomposition into vertical and horizontal (East-West) directions.Erosion susceptibilityErosion susceptibility has been&nbsp;estimated using RUSLE equation per each annuum, by considering several driving factors: topographic indices derived from digital elevation model, rainfall records, soils, presence of rehabilitation measures and vegetation cover.Landslide susceptibilityLandslide susceptibility has been&nbsp;estimated based on NGI model considering&nbsp; several driving factors: topographic indices derived from digital elevation model, rainfall records, lithology and geology, soil moisture and land cover maps from Product 3. <br/>

This dataset contains exuviae (larval skin remained behind after ecdysis) counts for 1 priority dragonfly species (Gomphus flavipes). Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an eventID, date, location and sampling protocol (in the event core), the length of the transect (in the measurement or fact extension) and for each occurrence an occurrenceID, the number of recorded individuals, status (present/absent), life stage, sex and scientific name (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/meetnetten-occurrences/issues

Generalized and/or withheld information: as these are sensitive priority species, location information is generalized to 1, 5 or 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells. Original locations are available upon request.

The Baseline scenario represents a projection of the world economy with corresponding energy demand and GHG's emissions under the assumption that the energy and climate objectives of the NDCs are achieved. The procedure that was used to generate Baseline scenario is called PIRAMID which stands for: Platform to Integrate, Reconcile and Align Model-based Input-output Data. PIRAMID is a new methodology to project Multi-Regional Input-Output tables over time. This approach allows for integrating data from external models and databases. The I-O tables are supplemented by energy balances (in physical units) and GHGs projections.

    dcterms:description """'PINK - Amphibia monitoring for the permanent surveillance of coastal areas in Flanders, Belgium.' is a sample based species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 1900 occurrences sampled between 2007-04-03 and 2016-07-05 from 243 ponds near the Belgian coast. The dataset includes over 10 species, collected in the PINK Amphibia subset. The monitoring of these coastal areas is needed to secure the nature conservation at the Belgian coast. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/dataset-pink-amphibia-events.

The data are collected for the project PINK (Permanente Inventarisatie van de Natuurreservaten aan de Kust), which was commissioned by the Agency for Nature and Forest in 2007. The project started with the aim of mapping the natural values on the coast in a more systematic way. A first 3-year phase (PINK I) ran from 2008 to 2010, in which the methodology was set up and an initial assessment was conducted. A second phase (PINK II) ran from 2012 to 2014, which was a continuation of the main components of PINK I, with special attention for invasive species and grasshoppers. A third phase (PINK III) is running from 2014 to 2018. This dataset contains mainly Amphibia occurrences observed during PINK I and PINK II.

This activation focuses on damage assessment and landslide risk assessment relating to major forest fires in the municipalities of Funchal and Calheta, Madeira in August 2016. Key assets (infrastructure, environment, human life, economic sustainability, etc.) are also identified and related with the severity of impact. The service involves:Post‐disaster assessment referring to loss of forest resources: Damage extent and gradingPre‐disaster mapping through an evaluation and assessment of landslide riskTo optimize the efficiency of the preventative measures to be implemented, risk maps (landslides) and damages maps (burnt areas, grading) at large scale (1:5,000) were generated.The core users are the Autoridade Nacional Prote&ccedil;&atilde;o Civil (ANPC) and the Institute of Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) of Portugal.The method used for burnt area delineation and burnt severity grading is based on thresholding of spectral indices, namely the NDVI and its differentiation in time (dNDVI) derived from pre-fire Pl&eacute;ades image and post fire (two dates) SPOT 6 and 7 acquisitions. Another index which was also calculated and used in combination with the NDVI/dNDVI is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and its time differentiation dEVI.For the assessment of landslide risk, the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) methodology was employed, which is a function of slope gradient, lithology, vegetation cover and soil moisture and based on a triggering factor of 100 year extreme monthly precipitation. &nbsp;Landslide risk was computed by overlaying the vulnerability assessment with the hazard map and it is categorized at different levels, based on the likelihood of landslide occurrence where assets are exposed, following the risk matrix of the European Commission &ldquo;Overview of natural and man‐made disaster risks in the EU&rdquo; (COM 2014).Tables on each map indicate the number of residents, built up surface area, the number of Points of Interest (POIs) and road segments (km) of the exposed elements at various risk levels (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High).&nbsp; <br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
The scope of the service request EMSN-066 is to delineate the extent and assess damage of 9 to 11 January 2020 flood event, in South-East Iran. As predicted by Copernicus EMS service GloFAS, days of heavy rain from 9 to 11 January 2020 caused severe flooding in southern Iran, in Sistan and Baluchestan, Hormozgan and south of Kerman provinces. Flooding has blocked roads and damaged houses, bridges, crops and infrastructure. Dozens of areas have been left isolated after roads were damaged or blocked. The results of this activation relate to service activation by DG ECHO &ndash; ERCC, on behalf of the Iranian Space Agency, in order to obtain data for evaluating the overall impact of this recent flood, for better planning and budgeting the recovery phase.This activation is complementary to CEMS RRM Standard activation EMSN067 (https://emergency.copernicus.eu/EMSN067).Multitemporal optical and radar Earth Observation data, consisted of pre-event and post-event Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 that covered the southern coast of Iran and as defined in the 3 Areas of interest, were used.Proposed solution and resultsProduct 1: Flood delineationFlood extent and delineation derived from pre and post-event satellite images using a semi-automatic approach combining optical and SAR data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 respectively.The workflow consisted on three steps:1) Extraction of the initial flooded areas from Sentinel-1 data,2) Calculation of NDWI using Sentinel-2 data and,3) Final delineation of the flooded areas by SAR &amp; Optical Data Fusion&nbsp;Product 2: Change detection of reservoirs and damsDelineation of the observed changes in surface extents of the reservoirs and dams within the flooded areas. The changes were mapped using the post-event Sentinel-1 &amp; Sentinel-2 images through semi-automatic procedures and manual photo- interpretation refinements.Product 3: Flood damage assessmentMapping of the damaged assets, population and Land Cover Land Use (LCLU) using semi-automatic procedures on the post-event Sentinel-2 Imagery. Affected areas are graded in three classes of damage from No Visible Damage / Possibly damaged / Damaged / Destroyed. <br/>

The scope is&nbsp;the assessment of the sinkhole risk in the mining area of Solotvyno, Zakarpattya region, Ukraine, in continuation of the previous service EMSN-030.

Event type: Storm <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
Friederike storm hit several countries across Western Europe in early 2018, causing extensive damages and traffic disruption. While centred over Germany winds speed up to 200 km/h caused&nbsp; severe damage across the country.The objective of the current activation is to provide a baseline database to perform a damage assessment on forests, after the storm Friederike in support of planning and forest management activities in Federal State of Hessen.&nbsp; The Hessen is the most forested state in Germany, covering up to 40% of its surface area. As such, the health of the forests is of importance to the economy of this region.Pre-event Forest UpdatingAn updated vector layer showing the pre-event extent of forests in the Area of Interest (AOI) is provided in the Land Use/Land Cover Feature Class (LULC).The forest classes of the German LULC dataset (2012) were updated using available pre-event SPOT 6 and 7 imagery (2016), acquired not more than 16 months prior to the Friederike wind-storm.This reference forest cover information was used as the base layer for the damage assessment area estimation.&nbsp;Forest damages assessmentThe damage assessment in forest areas was performed by comparison of the pre-event (2016) and post-event (2018) satellite imagery from SPOT 6 and 7 sensors (1.5 m resolution).&nbsp;Experienced photo interpreters looked for changes between the two dates. The changes detected were classified in three categories: Damage (clear evidences of damages, in red), Potential Damage (not strong evidences of damages, in orange) and Felling/clear cutting (areas under maintenance, in pink).&nbsp;&nbsp;In a final step, some conclusions can be drawn:The majority of the delineated damage present evidence of maintenance works on the forestIt makes sense that the maintenance works in damaged forest of the State of Hessen were in an advanced stage, due to several reasons:The main business in the area is timber industry.Broken logs after Friederike could have been wasted if not cleared away from winter weather conditions as soon as possible.Economic losses can be mitigated if performing early maintenance works.The post-event imagery used was acquired 4 and 6 months after the catastrophic event. <br/>

    dcterms:description "The Xylarium of Tervuren (Tw) : the collection of wood includes 56,000 specimens of 13,600 different botanical species from around the world. It is therefore the second largest collection in the world and the largest in Europe. It contains wood from all growing plant forms which produce secondary xylem. Lignified plant tissues are omnipresent in the terrestrial living nature. Also a big part of the material culture consists of wooden objects. Because of the multifunctional character of wood, the Tervuren Xylarium should in principle serve the different disciplines interested in wood research: technology, ecology, palaeontology, art history, archaeology, etc. Since the Tervuren Xylarium is the only governmental wood collection in Belgium there is no geographical limitation: it has a worldwide concern. Because of the scientific nature of the collection, the validation of it depends largely on derivative collections like thin sections for microscopy and microphotographs. Moreover there are collections of stem discs that make dendrochronological research possible."@en ;

    dcterms:description """This dataset series shows the Maximum Habitat Suitability (MHS, also known as survivability) map of Fraxinus ornus (raster format: geotiff). The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

Activation date: 2020-05-13 <br/> 
Event type: Forest fire, wild fire <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard has been activated to assess the damage occurred as a consequence of the forest fire which took place between the 20th and 27th of April 2020 in the Meinweg National Park. The Area of Interest (AOI) is located at the border region between Herkenbosch (Netherland) and Niederkr&uuml;chten (Germany).The post-disaster damage assessment study consists of the delineation and grading of the wildfire (P07), detailed damage assessment of the&nbsp;tree cover&nbsp;(P08.1), impact assessment on the land use/land cover (P15), using an update of the LULC data (P03.2), and the assessment of the soil erosion risk in the affected area (P16). Three&nbsp;monthly monitorings have being performed, aiming at observing possible worsening of the forest&rsquo;s health due to burnt trunks not visible in the first post-event satellite images.The results of this activation are briefly shown below and aim to support the Authorised User (AU) for planning recovery measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;P03.2 &ndash; LULC: CLC @ 1:25000 (update)The input data set consisted of 55 polygons of CLC2018 for the Dutch part. In the German part of the AOI 145 polygons&nbsp;of CLC5 were taken as a reference.&nbsp; The result of the update for the whole AOI is 629 polygons.P07&ndash; WILDFIRE DELINEATION AND GRADINGThe wildfire delineation product is based on change detection between two dates, that are prior and after the fire event; the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are calculated for each&nbsp;image and compared.&nbsp;These two indices represent the vegetation health state and have strong capabilities in extracting wildfires burned areas&nbsp;and impacts.&nbsp;The wildfire grading is computed using the wildfire delineation previously mapped and the dNBR layer.Total burnt area was 149.3 ha.P08.1 &ndash; DETAILED DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ANALYSES OVER AFFECTED&nbsp;AREAS (SCALE: 1:5,000)The product P08.1 depicts the after-event situation and illustrates the location of all affected forest areas&nbsp;within the wildfire delineation defined in the P07.&nbsp;The results of the trees damage assessment indicate that the consequences of the wildfire were&nbsp;not very extreme since only 35% of the isolated trees and 25% of tree cover were highly affected (for grading classes&nbsp;destroyed and severe damage).&nbsp;P15 &ndash; DETAILED IMPACT ASSESSMENT ANALYSES ON SELECTED ASPECT&nbsp;(SCALE: 1:5,000)The P15 product describes the impact of the wildfire event on the land use land cover.&nbsp;the most affected LULC is moors and heathland with 84.24 ha affected, of which&nbsp;40.44 are moderately affected and 39.33 highly affected to destroyed.&nbsp;The forested areas are represented mainly in the high damage and destroyed wildfire grading classes. Contrary to the&nbsp;rest of the AOI, coniferous and broad-leaved forests affected areas have fairly similar areas.P16&ndash; POST DISASTER EROSION RISK ASSESSMENTThe P16- Post-disaster soil erosion risk assessment product aims to deliver information about the soil status assessment&nbsp;over the burnt area. Since the vegetation has burnt, soil chemical and physical properties have changed due to the high&nbsp;temperatures during the fires.&nbsp;A soil erodibility model-based approach was chosen, more precisely, the well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss&nbsp;Equation (RUSLE).The soil loss&nbsp;susceptibility is mostly very small, occupying 98% of the AOI.&nbsp;&nbsp;WILDFIRE DAMAGE RECOVERY MONITORINGAfter the first post-event analysis, the area has been monitored a month later (i.e. on the 1st June 2020) and a second time on the 26th June 2020, aiming at providing further insights regarding the vegetation health. The study has been carried out through&nbsp;new P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product&nbsp;and associated P15-Impact assessment analyses on a selected aspect, based on Sentinel-2 images. The last monitoring will be carried out in August.P07- WILDFIRE DELINEATION AND GRADING&nbsp;&nbsp;P15- IMPACT ASSESSMENT ANALYSES ON A SELECTED ASPECT <br/>

Event type: Wildfire <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the Ciudad Real province (Castilla la Mancha region, Spain) on 12th July 2021. The wildfire hit especially the municipalities of Chill&oacute;n and Almad&eacute;n, where about 2000 ha of an agricultural land burnt. The goal of the activation is to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 1126 ha burnt, of which 499 ha only slightly damaged, 624 ha moderately damaged and 3.6 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the fire ravaged inside an unpopulated area. The several nearby settlements do not fall within the boundaries of the provided AOI leading to a very low population estimation. The main transportation network is dominated by unpaved service roads. There are no infrastructure assets with high commercial value. The burned area is of mixed agro-forestry land, broad-leaved forests, and further arable land. The damage to the agricultural sector was minimal, mostly affecting non-irrigated arable land. <br/>

    dcterms:description """Muskrat captures in Flanders, Belgium is an occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). It contains information on all officially registered captures of muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) in and around Flanders, Belgium between 1991 and 2018. These data are provided by different management actors: the Flanders Environment Agency (VMM), Rattenbestrijding Oost-Vlaanderen (RATO vzw), Polders and Wateringen (vvpw), and provincial and municipal trappers, and aggregated and analyzed by the INBO since 1991. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each occurrence record an occurrenceID, date, location, samplingProtocol (trap) and samplingEffort (number of days or traps), scientific name, and the organization who made the capture. The original dataset contains close to 450.000 occurrences and is available on GitHub, but only presence records (over 103.000) are included in this version, which can be used to track muskrat distribution in Flanders since 1991. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/mica-occurrences/issues

    dcterms:description """This dataset series refers to the information on long-term fire weather forecast provided by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). ▷_How to cite: see below_◁
  

Long-term fire weather forecast attempts to provide useful information about the near-time climate that can be expected in the coming months. The seasonal forecast is not a weather forecast: weather can be considered as a snapshot of continually changing atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is better considered as the statistical summary of the weather events occurring in a longer time interval, up to several years. Near-time climate focuses on statistics about a given season instead of multiple years. In particular, long-term monthly forecast estimates temperature and rainfall anomalies that are expected to prevail over European and Mediterranean areas during the next four weeks (including the current week). Long-term seasonal forecast, instead, focuses on temperature and rainfall anomalies that are expected to prevail over European and Mediterranean areas during the next 7 months (including the current month). Despite the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, long term predictions are possible to some degree thanks to a number of components which themselves show variations on long time scales (seasons and years) and, to a certain extent, are predictable. The most important of these components is the ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) cycle, which refers to the coherent, large-scale fluctuation of ocean temperatures, rainfall, atmospheric circulation, vertical motion and air pressure across the tropical Pacific. El Niño episodes (also called Pacific warm episodes) and La Niña episodes (also called Pacific cold episodes) represent opposite extremes of the ENSO cycle. The ENSO cycle is the largest known source of year-to-year climate variability.

Changes in Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are not the only cause of predictable changes in the weather patterns. There are other causes of seasonal climate variability. Unusually warm or cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic or Indian Ocean can cause major shifts in seasonal climate in nearby continents.

In addition to the tropical oceans, other factors that may influence seasonal climate are snow cover and soil wetness. All these factors affecting the atmospheric circulation constitute the basis of long-term predictions.

Overall, seasonal forecasting is justified by the long predictability of the oceanic circulation (of the order of several months) and by the fact that the variability in tropical SSTs has a significant global impact on the atmospheric circulation.

Seasonal forecasts provide a range of possible climate changes that are likely to occur in the season ahead. It is important to bear in mind that, because of the chaotic nature of the atmospheric circulation, it is not possible to predict the daily weather variations at a specific location months in advance. It is not even possible to predict exactly the average weather, such as the average temperature for a given month.

BEAM (Basic European Assets Map) provides a spatial data package for the estimation and comparison of real and potential damages caused by natural disasters. BEAM is based on spatial and statistical data available throughout Europe (Corine Land Cover, Urban Atlas) and enriched by national statistics information. The data model follows an approach, that can be applied across Europe, and is scalable from local to regional and national analysis. Data are stored as assets in monetary values per area unit (&euro;/m&sup2;). The complete BEAM information comprises different asset layers representing assets for various economic sectors, enabling the application of hazard specific damage (vulnerability) functions on individual BEAM layers. BEAM is composed of two major components: the asset data derived from the statistics and the land use and land cover data associated with them.The objective of the EMSN098 activation is the production of the BEAM dataset for the country of Sweden based on the most up-to-date asset layers and statistics available.Proposed solution and resultsCollection and preparation of geospatial input layers: LULC of Urban Atlas and Corine Land Cover, accompanied by data from the National Land Cover Database of Sweden and OpenStreetMapCollection and preparation of socio-economic data covering information on e.g. population, housing, vehicles, industry, services &amp; trade and agriculture from EUROSTAT and the national statistics agency of SwedenDerivation of asset layersCalculation of the normalized BEAM values&nbsp;BEAM example: Greater Stockholm area (Detail from the Stockholm County Map)General concept of BEAM asset and their use in risk assessment <br/>

These wildfires reached the exclusion zone and the surrounding environment (about 1 km) of the nuclear power plant from April 8, 2020 and they are up to now the biggest fires ever recorded in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. 
This event was of major interest due to the fact that since 1986, the forests have accumulated radioactivity, mostly concentrated in the wood and upper soil layers and, because of the fire haze these particles could be resuspended into the air and transported over long distances. Indeed the press reported detection of a small increase of cesium-137 concentrations in the air in Kiev, Germany, Norway, Greece and other countries. The EURDEP network also detected a slight increase of gamma dose rate with respect to the background in the proximity of the fire.

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the Directorate General for Regional Development (DG REGIO) of the European Commission support the GHSL activities. The GHSL contributes to the international partnership “GEO Human Planet Initiative”.
The GHSL methods rely on automatic spatial data mining technologies allowing the extraction of analytics and knowledge from large amount of heterogeneous data including global, fine-scale satellite-image data streams, census data, and crowd sources or volunteering geographic information sources. Spatial data reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures are necessary for any evidence-based modelling or assessing of i) human and physical exposure to threats as environmental contamination and degradation, natural disasters and conflicts, ii) impact of human activities on ecosystems, and iii) access to resources. 
The GHS Urban Centre Database (GHS- UCDB) describes spatial entities called “urban centres” accordingly to a set of multi-temporal thematic attributes gathered from the GHSL sources integrated with other sources available in the open scientific domain. The Urban Centres are defined by specific cut-off values on resident population and built-up surface share in a 1x1 km global uniform grid. The input data it is generated by the GHSL, and the operating parameters are set in the frame of the “degree of urbanization” (DEGURBA) methodology. The DEGURBA is a methodology for delineation of urban and rural areas made for international statistical comparison purposes that is developed by the European Commission, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UN-Habitat and the World Bank.
The reference GHSL input data used to delineate the Urban Centres are included in the Community pre-Release of GHS Data Package (GHS CR2018) in support to the GEO Human Planet Initiative. The parameter set used to delineate the Urban Centres from the input data are included in the GHSL settlement classification model SMODv9s10E 2018. The reference epoch for the spatial delineation of the Urban Centres is 2015. The attributes of the GHS-UCDB have different time depth for a maximum of 40 years, depending on availability of the input sources."""@en ;

The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard has been activated on behalf of the Ministry of Environment of the state of Brandenburg with the objective of assessing a flood event casued by heavy rainfall that hit the area of Rhin-Havelluch, District Oberhavel in Brandenburg (Germany) in June 2017. The peak of the precipitations occurred between the 29th and 30th June 2017. However, rainy days occurred during the next weeks, leading to the permanence of flooded areas until August 2017.The products generated in the framework of this activation aim at illustrating the evolution of the flood extent and at providing a quantification of affected urban areas, infrastructure and agricultural lands.Proposed solution and resultsFlood extent monitoring from Sentinel-1 acquisitions (30.06.2017-15.08.2017) within AOI01-Kremmen and AOI02-OranienburgModelled flood extent and water depth during the first week after the peak of the precipitation.Maximum water depth: 0.07-0.7mMaximum flood extent:&nbsp;AOI01: 12543.3 ha,&nbsp;AOI02: 7164.0 ha.Examples of maximum water extent and maximum water depth are shown in the following figures.&nbsp;Impact assessment based on the modelled maximum flood extent.Detailed damage assessment based on the visual interpretation of two VHR post-event optical images (both aquired on 20.07.2017) (examples of possible and moderate damaged buildings are shown in the following figures, respectively).&nbsp; <br/>

This publishing work has been done by the Belgian Biodiversity Platform (http://www.biodiversity.be) in the framework of the "GBIF award for evaluating checklist publication format" during May 2011.

Data extracted by Francis Strobbe on May 27th 2011.

Abstract of the Belgian Species List project:
Since almost a year now, people of all ages can access the Belgian Species List for an extensive overview of the biodiversity in Belgium. Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of more than 32.000 species!

The Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS – the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences – in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.

The purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that's been described, information is given on among other things the conservation status, the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards are fitted with pictures and interesting links.

The website is aimed at a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature conversationists and all nature lovers.

Some areas reported the worst flooding seen in a century.This activation was requested by the Minist&egrave;re de l&rsquo;Int&eacute;rieur, Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la S&eacute;curit&eacute; Civile et de la Gestion des Crises (COGIC).The scope of the request is to map flooding extents, infer maximum flooding and flood water depths, and assess the damage caused by the floods. &nbsp;Products include the following:Observed flood extent mapping &ndash; carried out principally by SAR Image classificationVarious SAR and optical sensors were used, including Sentienl-1, Radarsat-2, Cosmo-SkyMed, Deimos-2, Landsat-8 and Pl&eacute;ades.Maximum flood extent and estimated water depth mappingThe flood extent was computed by extrapolating the observed flood extent by the using a reference Digital Surface Model&nbsp; (DSM) , the IGN BD Alti&reg; (5m).The water depth is derived from the height difference between water surface of the maximum flood extent and the minimum values of the riverbed indicated by the DSM.Impact assessment on land useCreated from the overlay of the maximum flood extent contour and water depth layer over the land use/cover data.Impact assessment on populationCross-tabulation of the maximum flood extent and water depth layers with the population density data as a function of continuous and discontinuous urban fabric.&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description "The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which entered into force at the beginning of 2021, aims to boost intra-African trade and to accelerate economic development on the continent. This report complements previous continental economy-wide assessments of the impacts of the AfCFTA by providing a more comprehensive description of the trade agreement’s effects on food systems and food security. The report employs a global, multiregional model to determine the trade creation and diversion effects of four liberalisation scenarios defined by various policy objectives. The main findings show that the trade agreement will be a positive contributor both to economic growth through higher value added production and to trade diversification. Food consumption across the continent will also increase. A coordinated liberalisation approach to promote trade in agri-food products will further boost food security outcomes. Nevertheless, food prices will increase slightly in most regions, showing the need for further consideration of food affordability aspects in lower-income groups. Results also highlight the importance of non-tariff measures and the capacity of the AfCFTA to reduce the non-tariff costs of intra-African trade."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions represent around 10–12% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and have a key role to play in achieving a 1.5 °C (above pre-industrial) climate stabilization target. Using a multi-model assessment approach, we quantify the potential contribution of agriculture to the 1.5 °C target and decompose the mitigation potential by emission source, region and mitigation mechanism. The results show that the livestock sector will be vital to achieve emission reductions consistent with the 1.5 °C target mainly through emission-reducing technologies or structural changes. Agriculture may contribute emission reductions of 0.8–1.4 Gt of CO2-equivalents (CO2e) per year at just US$20 per tCO2e in 2050. Combined with dietary changes, emission reductions can be increased to 1.7–1.8 GtCO2e per year. At carbon prices compatible with the 1.5 °C target, agriculture could even provide average emission savings of 3.9 GtCO2e per year in 2050, which represents around 8% of current GHG emissions."@en ;

Event type: Flood <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
In June 2013, &nbsp;wide flooding and consequent damage and losses occurred in Central Europe, affecting especially Southern and Eastern Germany and some areas in Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland. It was one of the largest floods in the past two centuries.The outcome of EMSN-056 activation aims to provide further results to help in the analysis of this flood event dynamics. The current study delimits the flood extent of every available source, not analysed before, during more than one month from 02/06 to 05/07/2013 (Product 1), and chronologically compare results to provide information on the evolution of the event (Product 2).The time frame of interest (Summer of 2013) is previous to the European Sentinel satellites launch, hence the search of archived acquisitions included a wide number of sensors. SAR sensors, not affected by clouds, were prioritized but images were scarce; hence, the analysis also included optical imagery, being the cloud coverage too high in the available acquisitions. All the efforts were put in processing all types of images maximising the spatial and temporal coverage of results.Product 1: Observed Flood ExtentsIndividual extent of floods for each SAR image were obtained by exploiting the differences in backscatter between water and land surfaces applying a threshold of decibel values. The optical images have been analysed looking at the differences on spectral absorption characteristics of water bodies and ground objects in the visible and infrared bands. Results obtained from radar and optical approaches were refined and homogenised with the aim of making them comparable while ensuring the consistency of the product.Product 2: Evolution of Observed FloodsThe Evolution of the Observed Flood Extent for the period of interest has been analysed using the observed flood extents by date from Product 1. Only results sharing spatial coverage could be compared to study the evolution of the flood extents.Two reference figures were available to compare with: (1) The extent of the water in normal conditions (RNW) and (2) The extent of the flood for a return period of 200 years (200Y).&nbsp; Examples shown below correspond to AOI 01, where 8 dates were coincident in the 99% of the AOI. The complete results for the four AOIs are available in the activation report.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elbe River near Boizenburg, Germany (AOI 01) <br/>

    dcterms:description """Vector-borne diseases are a specific group of infections that present a (re-)emerging threat to Europe and require particular attention. The recent notifications of autochthonous transmission of dengue fever and chikungunya fever cases in Europe show its vulnerability to these diseases in areas where the vector, the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus , is present. Strengthening surveillance of exotic mosquito species such as Ae. albopictus , Aedes aegypti , Aedes atropalpus , Aedes japonicus , Aedes koreicus  and Aedes triseriatus , in areas at risk of importation or spread of mosquitoes and risk of virus transmission is therefore required. This is particularly important in the context of environmental and climate changes which might allow an increase of vector populations and virus amplification. The collection of information and data on vectors of public health (PH) significance are of crucial importance to understand the levels of risk that countries face, and to define the actions that need to be taken.

All the occurrences are collected during a surveillance study in 2012.

    dcterms:description """Blue shark (Prionace glauca) is amongst the most abundant shark species in international trade, however this highly migratory species has little effective management and the need for spatio-temporal strategies increases, possibly involving the most vulnerable stage or sex classes. We combined 265,595 blue shark observations (capture or satellite tag) with environmental data to present the first global-scale analysis of species’ habitat preferences for five size and sex classes (small juveniles, large juvenile males and females, adult males and females). 
We leveraged the understanding of blue shark biotic environmental associations to develop two indicators of foraging location: productivity fronts in mesotrophic areas and mesopelagic micronekton in oligotrophic environments. Temperature (at surface and mixed layer depth plus 100 m) and sea surface height anomaly were used to exclude unsuitable abiotic environments. To capture the horizontal and vertical extent of thermal habitat for the blue shark, we defined the temperature niche relative to both sea surface temperature (SST) and the temperature 100 m below the mixed layer depth (Tmld+100). 
We show that the lifetime foraging niche incorporates highly diverse biotic and abiotic conditions: the blue shark tends to shift from mesotrophic and temperate surface waters during juvenile stages to more oligotrophic and warm surface waters for adults. However, low productivity limits all classes of blue shark habitat in the tropical western North Atlantic, and both low productivity and warm temperatures limit habitat in most of the equatorial Indian Ocean (except for the adult males) and tropical eastern Pacific. Large females tend to have greater habitat overlap with small juveniles than large males, more defined by temperature than productivity preferences. In particular, large juvenile females tend to extend their range into higher latitudes than large males, likely due to greater tolerance to relatively cold waters. Large juvenile and adult females also seem to avoid areas with intermediate SST (~21.7-24.0°C), resulting in separation from large males mostly in the tropical and temperate latitudes in the cold and warm seasons, respectively. 
The habitat requirements of sensitive size- and sex-specific stages to blue shark population dynamics are essential in management to improve conservation of this near-threatened species.

The dataset contains over 3,700 sampling events, carried out since 2009, mostly in the months June and July. The data are compiled from different summering geese related projects, but most data were collected through fieldwork within the framework of the EU co-funded Interreg projects INVEXO (http://www.invexo.eu) and RINSE (www.rinse-europe.eu). Since 2015, data collection is funded by INBO. The dataset includes close to 5,000 presence occurrences, as well as over 15,000 absence occurrences. The sampling protocol for the majority of the occurrences are simultaneous counts. Here, the number of individuals of different geese species in a fixed set of areas is determined. Counts are performed within the same weekend to avoid double counting. Simultaneous counts were organised yearly since 2008 and take place the first weekend after July 15, the best period for monitoring the summering population of geese. These counts are performed by professional INBO employees as well as experienced birdwatchers from Natuurpunt using a standardized field protocol. Data are recorded in a citizen science portal (http://waarnemingen.be/waarnemingen_projecten.php?project=231). However, The dataset also comprises opportunistic field observations from the same portal outside this period. Furthermore, data are derived from management actions, such as fertility reduction (egg shaking and pricking), the use of Larsen traps (for Egyptian goose), and the execution of moult captures. Here, the individuals in the dataset were actually removed from the environment. The aim of the data collection is management follow-up and evaluation. Consequently, caution is advised when using these data for trend analysis, distribution range calculation, niche modeling or other. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/zomerganzen-events

Nuyens).

The constituent documents (maps and associated reports) provide an overview of the following points: 
- tests carried out in the region ;
- depth of the water table ;
- nature and position of the tertiary substratum ;
- nature and strength of the various surface layers;
- units with a specific overlay of the formations encountered.

Their initial objective was to respond to the needs of the builders for synthetic and easily accessible documentation relating to the subsoil of the Brussels region. The plates and documents provided did not claim absolute precision because of the interpolations and extrapolations necessary for their establishment. 

The present archive is presented in three forms:
- Digitized maps and associated FR/NL explanatory notes .pdf ;

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

    dcterms:description """A first comprehensive account on the dolichopodid fauna (Diptera: Dolichopodidae) of Portugal is presented here as the result of multiple surveys by primarily Portuguese researchers between 2009 and 2016. All mainland Portuguese provinces and all districts but one (Évora) were investigated. A total of 761 dolichopodid samples were collected in 278 sampling sites distributed over 87 municipalities and 182 localities, with nearly ¾ of the samples gathered by sweepnet. In terms of generic representation, the Portuguese dolichopodid fauna occupies an intermediate position between those of northwestern European and other Mediterranean countries. Despite the large amount of data gathered, the dolichopodid fauna of Portugal remains insufficiently known and a considerable number of additional known and new species can be expected with continued sampling. A more exhaustive description of the dataset and the results of the surveys can be found in Pollet et al. (2019).

EMSN034 is a pre-disaster situation analyses to provide thematic information supporting planning for contingencies on vulnerable coastal areas along with a European framework directive on the assessment and management of the flood risk (2007/60/EC). Area of interest is 14 kilometres of beaches in Costa da Caparica, 10 km south of Lisbon, and the belt of land of with width of 1,5 km, along the shore line. Main earth observation data, imagery and digital elevation models, were provided by the activator ANPC (airborne) and JRC (RPAS-borne).Risk and recovery products are oriented to minimize casualties and economic impact in case of Tsunami event. Two sets of coastal flooding and storm surges hazards are developed. First based on computing values of total sea level elevation (SLE) integrating the different components that contribute to total water level during a storm: barometric setup, wind setup, wave setup and astronomical tide, plus a component of sea level rise to account for future climate change. The second approach is constructed based on the creation of a Flood Hazard Index. The four variables that compose the index are breaking wave height, beach slope, nearshore slope and presence of engineering structures. Results for five different probability scenarios ranging from frequent (corresponding to a return period of 5 years) to improbable (corresponding to a return period of 100 years) are calculated.This work is complemented by coastal erosion hazard analyses assessed by constructing an Erosion Hazard Index (EHI), which is composed of three variables: recent rates of shoreline change, presence and characteristics of dunes, and presence of artificial protection structures.Potential suitable locations for first response activities and access roads and evacuation routes are proposed. Mitigation, preparedness and response measures are also described and include, among the others: relocation of sensitive buildings, safe shelters, sand dunes protection, coastal structures, information, warning and alert system, etc. <br/>

The Regulation EEC No 804/94 (now expired) established a Community system of information on forest fires for which a systematic collection of a minimum set of data on each fire occurring, the so called “Common Core”, had to be carried out by the Member States participating in the system. This regulation was replaced by the Forest Focus regulation in 2003.

Following the Forest Focus regulation (EC) No 2152/2003, concerning monitoring of forests and environment interactions in the Community, the forest fire common core data was continued to be recorded in order to collect comparable information on forest fires at Community level.

Since 2000 the forest fire data provided each year by individual EU Member States and other countries in Europe, Middle East and North Africa are checked, stored and managed by JRC within EFFIS. At present the database contains fire data from 22 countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey.

Updated annual country totals supplied separately by the same authorities are available for download in EFFIS. Users can request custom annual or monthly summaries of burnt area or number of fires by country, NUTS2 or NUTS3 region, from the Point of contact.

The project covers major world competitors including 40 advanced and emerging countries - the EU28 plus Norway, Russia and Switzerland in Europe, Canada, the United States and Brazil in the Americas, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in Asia, and Australia -. The dataset provides indicators in a wide variety of topics, including value added, employment, labour productivity and business R&D expenditure (BERD), distinguishing fine grain economic activities in ICT industries (up to 22 individual activities, 14 of which at the class level, i.e. at 4 digits in the ISIC/NACE classification), media and content industries (15 activities, 11 of them at 4 digit level) and at a higher level of aggregation for all the other industries in the economy. It also produces data on Government financing of R&D in ICTs, and total R&D expenditure. Nowcasting of more relevant data in these domains is also performed until a year before the reference date, while time series go back to 1995.

ICTs determine competitive power in the knowledge economy. The ICT sector alone originates almost one fourth of total Business expenditure in R&D (BERD) for the aggregate of the 40 economies under scrutiny in the project. It also has a huge enabling role for innovation in other technological domains. This is reflected at the EU policy level, where the Digital Agenda for Europe in 2010 was identified as one of the seven pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy for growth in the Union; and the achievement of a Digital Single Market (DSM) is one of the 10 political priorities set by the Commission since 2015."""@en ;

EMSN033 is a satellite based conflict damage assessment of three selected areas of interest (AOIs) in Libya: Benghazi city, Benghazi&acute;s Aerodrome (El Benina) and Al-Jawf.The scope of the map production was to generate general reference content of the pre-event situation, including administrative boundaries, road network, urban land use classification, urban sprawl and urban expansion velocity analysis.The core users of the map are the Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) of the European Commission and United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).The risk and recovery product is a damage assessment point layer representing all affected assets. Damages were detected by visual comparison of pre-event WorldView-2 images from 2012-2013 to the most up-to-date imagery WorldView-3 from 2017. Observations are classified into 4 categories: destroyed asset, severe, moderate or possible damage.Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used to identify the built-up area based on Landsat 4-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and Global Land Survey data with a spatial resolution of 30m.To compute urban sprawl, satellite images were classified as built-up and not built-up for reference years of 1988, 2000, 2010 and 2016.&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description "The Canary Islands (Spain) are an archipelago of the coast of northwest Africa. Gran Canaria is the third-largest island and located in the centre (Carracedo & Troll, 2016). The island contains a number endemic land snail species (e.g. Brito & Fraga, 2010). Freshwater molluscs are of smaller significance, but are also present. The research of land and freshwater molluscs of the Canaries mainly goes back to the 19th century with the famous works of Webb & Berthelot (1833), Shuttleworth (1852a, 1852b), Mousson (1872), Wollaston (1878), Mabille (1884), Odhner (1931), and others. Recent checklists are available (Groh, 1985; Bank et al., 2002; Brito & Fraga, 2010; Helixebas, 2019) and some more recent papers are cited further in this article. Nevertheless, taxonomic research is still largely based on these old works and many species were never found again since their description or the ecology or proper range is not known. This, together with the threats of global warming (Luque et al., 2013) and the increase of demographic and touristic pressure (Ibáñez et al., 1997)  could (and probably already has) detrimental consequences for the survival of these species (see also the assessments on https://www.iucnredlist.org/). Therefore, there is an urgent need for information on ecology, distribution and taxonomy. “Land and freshwater molluscs of Gran Canaria (Spain)” is an occurrence dataset containing 389 observations of 62 different taxa of land and freshwater molluscs encountered on Gran Canaria, an island central in the Canarian archipelago (Spain). Various sites were inspected in a period between 1988 to 2020. The aim is to contribute to the knowledge on the ecology and distribution of these species on the island such that it may aid conservation and research of these organisms in the future. The dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each observation a stable occurrenceID, scientific name, date, and location of the observation, as well as info on lifeStage and organismQuantity, and supplementary remarks on the determination and the observation itself.

    dcterms:description """Florabank1 is a database that contains distributional data on the wild flora (indigenous species, archeophytes and naturalised aliens) of Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region. It holds about 3 million records of vascular plants, dating from 1800 till present. Furthermore, it includes ecological data on vascular plant species, redlist category information, Ellenberg values, legal status, global distribution, seed bank etc. The database is an initiative of "Flo.Wer" (http://www.plantenwerkgroep.be), the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) (http://www.inbo.be) and the National Botanic Garden of Belgium (http://www.br.fgov.be). Florabank aims at centralizing botanical distribution data gathered by both professional and amateur botanists and to make these data available to the benefit of nature conservation, policy and scientific research. The occurrence data contained in Florabank1 are extracted from checklists, literature and herbarium specimen information. Of survey lists, the locality name (verbatimLocality), species name, observation date and IFBL square code - the grid system used for plant mapping in Belgium (Van Rompaey 1943) - are recorded. For records dating from the period 1972–2004 all pertinent botanical journals dealing with Belgian flora were systematically screened. Analysis of herbarium specimens in the collection of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium, the University of Ghent and the University of Liège provided interesting distribution knowledge concerning rare species, this information is also included in Florabank1.

The IFBL data recorded before 1972 is available through the Belgian GBIF node (http://www.gbif.org/dataset/940821c0-3269-11df-855a-b8a03c50a862), not through Florabank1, to avoid duplication of information. A dedicated portal providing access to all currently published Belgian IFBL records is available at: http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl.

All data in Florabank1 is georeferenced. Every record holds the decimal centroid coordinates of the > IFBL square containing the observation. The uncertainty radius is the smallest circle possible covering the whole IFBL square, which can measure 1 km² or 4 km². Florabank is a work in progress and new occurrences are added as they become available; the dataset will be updated through GBIF on a regularly base."""@en ;

The model was calibrated at 1226 river sections, with total drainage area of 51 million km2 and within 66 world countries, using at least 4 years of observed discharges and ECMWF’s ERA5 as meteorological input dataset. The same dataset and the calibrated model are then used to run a hydrological simulation for the period 1979-2018, where the first year was discarded to allow for model warm-up, to ultimately obtain a 39-year continuous streamflow reanalysis.

The dataset contains over 761.000 butterfly occurrences of 70 species, compiled by the INBO in cooperation with the Butterfly working group of Natuurpunt (Vlinderwerkgroep). The occurrences are georeferenced using the centroid of their respective 5 x 5 km² Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cell and are derived from the database Vlinderdatabank at the INBO, which consists of (historical) collection and literature data (1830-2001), for which all butterfly specimens in institutional and available personal collections were digitized and all entomological and other relevant publications were checked for butterfly distribution data. It also contains observations and monitoring data for the period 1991-2014. (erratum 2021, the monitoring data is moved to https://doi.org/10.15468/wwrgcd) The latter type were collected by a (small) butterfly monitoring network where butterflies were recorded using a standardized protocol. Together with the dataset Vanreusel et al. (2016, https://doi.org/10.15468/ezfbee), the dataset represents the most complete overview of butterflies in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region (north Belgium).

The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard has been activated by EEAS (European External Action Service) on behalf of the World Bank Group in order to support EU Delegation, World Bank, UN and AfDB in a Recovery and Peace Building Assessment. This aims at understanding causes of the conflict in the North of Mozambique, and at developing a strategy for future Government&rsquo;s intervention in the area. The ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province started in October 2017 with attacks by insurgents. The attacks have since escalated and gained in range and sophistication. Thousands of people have died and hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced.The goal of the activation is to support the RPBA through the monitoring of the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps within six AOIs in Cabo Delgado Province, to analyse their status and composition, highlighting also the changes&nbsp;occurring from May/June 2021 to August/September 2021.Proposed solution and resultsThe updated P19-Population displacement location products are generated through photointerpretation of VHR satellite images acquired in August/September 2021. They provide information about possible changes with respect to May/June 2021, in terms of camp types (e.g. permanent, temporary, IDP camps, etc.), extension and composition (e.g. tents, shelters, facilities, etc.), estimated population and density.The P13- Ready to print maps and map books for field campaigns products include detail maps of each of the P19 products generated, with a focus on the mapped camps.&nbsp;Figure 1.

It is part of the Meetnetten.be suite of monitoring networks for priority species in Flanders, in which data are collected at fixed locations using a standardized protocol (https://meetnetten.be). This dataset contains counts of the Saddle-backed Bush Cricket Ephippiger ephippiger in Flanders. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an event ID, date, location, sampling effort and sampling protocol (in the event core) and for each occurrence and occurrence ID, the number of recorded individuals, status (present/absent), life stage and scientific name (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/meetnetten-occurrences/issues

Generalized and/or withheld information: as these are sensitive priority species, location information is generalized to 1, 5 or 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells. Original locations are available upon request.

Event type: Wildfire <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the Spanish province of Salamanca (Spain), on 17th August 2021. Active flames were located in San Felices de los Gallegos and Ba&ntilde;ob&aacute;rez, as well as in the areas known as La Granja and Los Navazos, on the edge of the Arribes del Duero natural park. The presence of several outbreaks suggests that it could have been an intentional fire.The goal of the activation has been to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 1608.22 ha burnt, of which 1596.21 ha only slightly damaged and 12.01 ha moderately damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the damage from the fire has not been serious. The largest damaged area was covered by sclerophyllous vegetation. Damage to the agricultural sector was minimal, but several warehouse buildings were affected. <br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
The scope of the service request EMSN032 is to generate damage delineation and grading maps of 41 different forest fires in mainland Portugal that occurred in July and August 2016. The affected area had an overall extent of 887 km&sup2;.The service consists of detailed reference maps and damage delineation and grading. Additionally, assessment of post-event slope stability, erosion and accessibility to the affected areas were requested. All layers were produced at the cartographic scale of 1:25,000.The core users are the Autoridade Nacional Prote&ccedil;&atilde;o Civil (ANPC) and the Institute of Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) of Portugal.The damage grading is based on classification of a Sentinel-2 image, acquired after the event, taking advantage of both the NIR and SWIR bands. The NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) was used for damage grading into 3 classes: Heavily burnt (red), partially burnt (yellow) and not burnt (green). Results were overlaid with land use/cover classes. The maps are accompanied by consequence tables showing the area of each land cover class per burnt category in square kilometres.Erosion Risk was evaluated in terms of soil loss, based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a function of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and gradient, the protective influence of vegetation and anti-erosion measures.&nbsp; <br/>

The dataset contains close to 8.5 million occurrences (GPS fixes) recorded by GPS trackers mounted on 108 Lesser Black-backed Gulls and 37 Herring Gulls breeding at the Belgian and Dutch coast. The trackers are developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl) and allow to study the gulls' habitat use and migration behaviour in great detail. Our bird tracking network is operational since 2013 and is maintained and used by the INBO, the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), UvA-BiTS, Ghent University (UGent), and the University of Antwerp (UA). See the dataset metadata for contact information, scope, and methodology. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/bird-tracking-gull-occurrences

The following information is not included in the dataset and available upon request: outliers, temperature, speed, accelerometer data, GPS metadata (fix time, number of satellites used, vertical accuracy), bird biometrics data measured during tagging (bill length, bill depth, tarsus length, wing length, body mass), life history data (day of ringing, age, resightings by volunteers), as well as growth data of chicks.

To allow anyone to use this dataset, we have released the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We would appreciate however, if you read and follow these norms for data use (http://www.inbo.be/en/norms-for-data-use) and provide a link to the original dataset (http://doi.org/10.15468/02omly) whenever possible.

It is part of the Meetnetten.be suite of monitoring networks for priority species in Flanders, in which data are collected at fixed locations using a standardized protocol (https://meetnetten.be). This dataset contains site counts for 2 priority butterfly species, as well as other butterflies observed during sampling. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an eventID, date, location and sampling protocol (in the event core), the cloudiness, temperature, and wind force at the time of the event (in the measurement or fact extension) and for each occurrence an occurrenceID, the number of recorded individuals, status (present/absent) and scientific name (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/meetnetten-occurrences/issues

Generalized and/or withheld information: as these are sensitive priority species, location information is generalized to 1, 5 or 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells. Original locations are available upon request.

Event type: Flood <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard has been activated for a retrospective assessment of the flood event that took place in Solingen (North Rhine Westphalia area, Germany). A series of storm events throughout June and July 2021 left the ground saturated, followed by heavy rainfalls from the 12th July and particularly on the 14th July 2021. A severe flood event occurred over the next few days along the Moselle, Rhine and Ruhr rivers. The Germany&rsquo;s weather service Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) reported that at least 7 locations recorded more than 150 mm of rain in 72 hours to 15th July 2021. The period considered for the analysis is between the 13th July and the 16th July 2021.Proposed solution and resultsA hydraulic modelling approach has been adopted to provide the temporal analysis of the occurred flood event (P06 product) in terms of maximum flood extent, maximum water depth, and flood temporal evolution estimated during the period 13th July 2021 &ndash; 16th July 2021. The model has been calibrated using two P04-Flood delineation products depicting the flood footprint extracted from Sentinel-1 acquisitions taken on the 15th July (517 ha) and the 16th July 2021 (269 ha)The maximum flood extent retrieved from the hydraulic modelling is 1340 ha.

It contains information on more than 94,000 sampling events (bird counts) with over 720,000 observations (and zero counts when there is no associated occurrence) for the period 1991-2016, covering 167 species in over 1,100 wetland sites. The aim of these bird counts is to gather information on the size, distribution and long term trends of wintering waterbird populations in Flanders. These data are also used to assess the importance of individual sites for waterbirds, using quantitative criteria. Furthermore, the waterbird counts contribute to international monitoring programs, such as the International Waterbird Census (coordinated by Wetlands International) and fulfil some of the objectives of the European Bird Directive, the Ramsar Convention, and the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Here the dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each event: a stable eventID, date and location of observation, and a short description of the sampling protocol, effort and conditions (in the event core), supplemented with specific information for each occurrence: a stable occurrenceID, the scientific name and higher classification of the observed species, the number of recorded individuals, and a reference to the observer of the record (in the occurrence extension).

This data base deals with the following research topic: Evolutionary histories of organisms and affects of palaeoclimatic changes: Species flocks of ancient freshwater lakes: African cichlid fishes (lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, Victoria and Kivu). Our primary area of interest is the study of the evolution of the cichlid species flocks from the East African Rift lakes. We investigate their phylogenesis, speciation, and the influence of lake level changes on their evolution. We also study the genetic structure of cichlid populations and the role of past and recent ecological barriers that determine population substructuring. Finally, we use molecular phylogenies to elucidate evolutionary patterns of morphological change and population genetic data to analyse the consequences of fisheries and environmental degradation. These approaches require both extensive field and laboratory phases of investigation. Our current research is based on an extensive tissue collection for cichlids from lakes Victoria, Kivu, Tanganyika and Malawi and uses mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers to address evolutionary problems on selected taxa from these species flocks."@en ;

This is essential in the perspective of the ongoing global changes creating suitable conditions for the spread of invasive species and the (re)emergence of vector-borne diseases in Europe. The main strengths of the Modirisk project in the context of sustainable development are the link between biodiversity and health-environment, and its contribution to the development of tools to better describe the spatial distribution of mosquito biodiversity. MODIRISK addresses key topics of the global initiative Diversitas, which was one of the main drivers of the 'Research programme Science for a Sustainable Development' www.belspo.be (SSD).

This is essential in the perspective of the ongoing global changes creating suitable conditions for the spread of invasive species and the (re)emergence of vector-borne diseases in Europe. The main strengths of the project in the context of sustainable development are the link between biodiversity and health-environment, and its contribution to the development of tools to better describe the spatial distribution of mosquito biodiversity. MODIRISK addresses key topics of the global initiative Diversitas, which was one of the main drivers of the 'Research programme Science for a Sustainable Development' (SSD).

The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the in the municipality of Alcaracejos, in the region of Cordoba-Andaluc&iacute;a (Spain), on 16th August 2021. According to Infoca Plan, the initial damage assessment resulted in about 610 ha burnt; the fire not only destroyed an important hunting land in the area and numerous mountains, but it also caused material losses suffered by the neighbouring farmhouses, chalets, agricultural holdings and farms of area.The goal of the activation is to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 601.9 ha burnt, of which 385.5 ha only slightly damaged, 204.9 ha moderately damaged, and 11.5 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the fire ravaged inside an unpopulated area. Only the surrounding area of Alcaracejos is located within the boundaries of the AOI, leading to a low population estimation within the AOI itself. The fire affected 1.3 km primary road, 4.2 km cart track, 0.1 km path. Nearby towns were not damaged, however, several isolated industrial buildings were affected. The largest damaged area was covered by Sclerophyllous vegetation and Olive groves. <br/>

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

Activation date: 2018-04-04 <br/> 
Event type: Storm <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The objective of this&nbsp;activation is to provide a general reference content to support activities of administration in reconstruction work of damage caused by Cyclone Matthew (October 2016) over two areas of interest containing the cities of J&eacute;r&eacute;mie and Les Cayes, and to understand vulnerabilities during the recovery period. The focus of EMSN-050 activation was the detection of buildings and assets of all kinds affected by the cyclone, and understanding how people temporarily had to relocate their dwelling to the so called Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps, while the reconstruction works were taking place.The technical approach was to build a complete GDB containing the baseline data, and the status of assets and IDP camps in all the required stages, using a common schema in order to make them comparable. Based on the information extracted through visual interpretation of satellite imagery, spatial and temporal analysis was then performed by comparing the status of assets and IDP camps between the different stages.Results are presented in tables containing, between other indicators, damage to assets, statistics at each monitoring interval, reconstruction progress rates, grouped by administrative boundary of interest (i.e.: sub-commune).Pre-event baseline conditions (t0) were compared against post-event situation in three time steps:t1: days after the event.t2: approx. approx. 6 months after (only IDP camps).t3: approx. approx. 12 months after.The products are:Evolution state of the IDP camps.Damage assessment of assets, focusing on buildings, and monitoring of reconstruction activities of the affected assets.Evolution of IDP camps in three time stages (t1, t2, t3)IDPs camps were mapped in three time stages. Indications for precarious housing such groupings of dwellings with a disordered arrangement were searched by visual means using three sets of imagery and were collected at their corresponding time stage.Overall, very low numbers of putative IDP dwellings have been observed for both AOIs at t1. This suggests that in the few days following the passage of the storm until the satellite image acquisition, most affected people had not yet constructed new shelters. At time t2, numbers of potential IDP dwellings have risen in both sites, but remain low. Thus, the low number of potential IDP dwellings does not imply a low number of internally displaced persons.Damage assessment and monitoring of reconstruction: study of the evolution of&nbsp; building status in three time stages (t0, t1, t3)More than 115,000 building footprints were manually digitized by photointerpretation of pre-event ortho image and post-event satellite imagery. The status of every building was coded in three time stages, pre-event (t0), near post-event (t1) and one year after the event (t3). The damage assessment immediately after the hurricane Matthew was assessed by comparing two time stages: Status_t0 and Status_t1. Before the hurricane, 96-97% of the buildings in both AOIs appeared to be functional. Immediately after Matthew, the 93-94% of the buildings in both AOIs presented evidence of damage, visible from above, such as destroyed roofs. Only a 5-7% presented no visible damages far from presence of water on top of flat concrete roofed houses.The reconstruction status was monitored by comparison of the three status codes at the three time stages: Status_t0, Status_t1 and Status_t3. The possible combination of codes was analysed and their meaning interpreted.The aggregated figures led to the following main conclusions:There was an important reconstruction effort in the first year after Matthew, with a total of 61% of buildings recovered up to the beginning of 2018.But there is still an 8% pending of recovery activities.The buildings that are not vulnerable to cyclones in both AOIs do not even reach 6% of the total.There is a remarkable number of additional buildings in t3 with respect to pre-event conditions, representing an additional 10% of the total buildings in t3.&nbsp; <br/>

They provide a wide range of riparian functions (e.g. chemical filtration, flood control, bank stabilization, aquatic life and riparian wildlife support, etc.) and ecosystem services.

		The Riparian Zones products will support the objectives of several European legal acts and policy initiatives, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Water Framework Directive.

		Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) classification is tailored to the needs of biodiversity monitoring in a tailored buffer zone along large and medium-sized European rivers (with Strahler levels 3-8 derived from EU-Hydro). LC/LU is extracted from VHR satellite data and other available data in a buffer zone of selected rivers. The classes follow the pre-defined nomenclature on the basis of MAES typology of ecosystems (Level 1 to Level 4) and Corine Land Cover, providing 80 distinct thematic classes with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha and a Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of 10 m.

		The production of the Riparian Zones products was coordinated by the European Environment Agency in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme."""@en ;
