Primary objective of the service is provision of spatially and temporally consistent, dense and synoptic results giving insight on distribution and variance of subsidence phenomena in space and its dynamics in time. Persistent scatterers interferometry technique (PSI) and stacks of archive SAR imagery from Sentinel-1 sensor were used to measure displacements caused by ground subsidence and to estimate its average velocity in vertical direction.Average Ground Subsidence VelocityThe product shows patterns of estimated ground subsidence rate (i.e. its average velocity) in vertical direction for persistent scatterer points. The points and their displacement velocity in time were identified by PSI technique from stacks of Sentinel-1 images acquired within reference period November 2014 - January 2019.&nbsp;The result provide means to evaluate the ground subsidence patterns at various scales. Each PS point has an associated plot of displacement trend. Plots can be used to evaluate level of stability of temporal trend of ground subsidence for individual points: i.e. whether displacement rate is constant in time, has spatially related temporal patterns (fluctuations) or if accelerates in time.&nbsp;The product was not validated against ground data.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>

SPAIN’S Costa del Sol and Malaga are being affected by torrential rains since Saturday, 20 October.

One person has died (one firefighter) after heavy rains triggered flash floods. The strength of the waters overturned cars, closed roads, damaged homes and forced hundreds of people to leave their properties.

Andalucia is placed under a dangerous red alert severe flooding. Thunderstorms and torrential rain have left Andalucian towns almost engulfed in water.<br/>

It includes a significant collection of skeletons and eggs as well as type material for 92 species. It is one of the Institute's oldest collections and for much of the historical material, including the tropical birds, the Institute owes thanks to ornithologist Bernard du Bus de Gisignies, the first director of the Museum of Natural Sciences in 1848. Alphonse Dubois, who was appointed curator of the vertebrate collections in 1869, was the first to describe many of De Gisignies’ specimens. In the 1930s Zoologist René Verheyen added a great deal of material to the ornithological collections and in particular, an exceptionally large collection of Belgian and Central African fauna.

The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS).

The scope of the service request was to generate Forest Fire Risk assessment analyses and mitigation products covering a set of 27 focus areas in Croatia. Apart from the General Reference context the following Risk and Recovery products were generated:Forest Fire exposure and risk, as well as vulnerability of people and assetsRisk - specific mitigation measures suggestionsCritical information for the development and management of first response infrastructures&nbsp; &nbsp;Assets &amp; Population Exposure &amp; Vulnerability&nbsp;The assessment of the forest fire hazard takes in to account both fire intensity and surface properties. The generation of a forest fire index layer was based on specific assumptions and takes in to account anaglyph, aspect &amp; height zones, vegetation cover, climatological conditions and historical forest fires records. Forest fire hazard maps show the hazard levels in forested and semi natural areas, as well as certain heterogeneous agricultural areas. Urban environment and arable land classes are excluded from the forest fire hazard assessment.The exposure layer was generated automatically, by overlaying the forest fire hazard layer, with detailed information on population density and assets: transportation network, POIs &amp; LULC.The vulnerability assessment of the exposed elements was calculated by considering specific criteria that characterize vulnerability to fires and distinguishes urban from non-urban areas.Statistical analysis was carried out, showing the potential severity of the impact on assets and population.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transportation Network Vulnerability to Disruption&nbsp;Vulnerability of disruption estimated through accounting for the following parameters:Road capacity inferred by the respective taxonomy (primary, secondary, etc.)Proximity to population placesPopulation (residents)An appropriate buffer, per road segment (of similar capacity), was used to estimate the nearby population density, that (potentially) generates the traffic load, to serve as input for alternative routing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Population, Assets &amp; Transportation Network at Risk&nbsp;Forest fires risk assessment was based on the combination of forest fire hazard and vulnerability of the exposed elements. Forest fire risk estimation depends on the type of biomass fuel and the proximity of population and assets to the most hazardous areas in terms of forest fire activity. Transport network risk is estimated as the combined effect of hazard and vulnerability to disruption.First Aid areas and the appropriate mitigation measures generated, using appropriate spatial analysis, aiming to provide elaborated suggestions for efficiently addressing civil protection and response efforts.&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description """In this study we analyzed the global future trends in extreme wave energy flux along coastlines under a scenario of high emission of greenhouse gases. By the end of the century, results show a significant increase up to 30% in the wave power of the one-every-100-year storm for the majority of the coastal areas of the Southern Temperate Zone, and a more than doubling frequency of extreme events, while in the Northern Hemisphere large coastal areas are characterized by a significant negative trend. We show that the most significant long term trends of extreme WEF can be explained by an intensification of climatic patterns such as the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The projected changes will have broad implications for ocean engineering applications and disaster risk management. Especially low-lying coastal countries in the Southern Hemisphere will be particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of projected Sea Level Rise and more extreme wave activity.

Due to the progressive spread of the bacterium and the potentially threatening other crops and regions, this emergency has assumed severe proportions, with heavy economic, environmental and social consequences. In order to manage the emergency, a special task force has been defined. 
The emergency plan foreseen the eradication of all the plants potentially affected by the infection, in order to create a phytosanitary barrier to stop its expansion.<br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the in the municipality of Alburquerque in the region of Badajoz (Spain), on 18th August 2021. It spread in different directions, burning cultivated areas, grassland and mountains, until it was extinguished on 22nd August. &nbsp;The goal of the activation is to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 607 ha burnt, of which 467 ha only slightly damaged, 122 ha moderately damaged, and 18 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the fire ravaged inside an unpopulated area. Only the surrounding area of Alburquerque is located within the boundaries of the AOI, leading to a low population estimation within the AOI itself. The fire affected 13 km of cart tracks. Nearby towns were not damaged, however, several isolated industrial buildings were affected. In terms of area, the highest total damage was suffered in the Sclerophyllous vegetation (171.7 ha) and Broad-leaved forest (182.4 ha). <br/>

<br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
During the morning of July 24, the area near the town of Bonarcado in the province of Oristano, in Sardinia, was affected by large fires that spread very quickly due to several factors including strong southerly winds, high temperatures and vegetation prone to fire. The fires affected farms, crops and houses and led to the evacuation of 800 people. Several ground firefighting teams and regional resources supported by national and regional air resources were deployed. The fires are still affecting large areas involving brush forests, wildlands and urban interface areas. The Italian government has also activated the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism in support of the national resources. France deployed 2 Canadair aircraft from the European Civil Protection Pool (ECPP) and the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) mobilised 2 additional Canadair aircraft from the rescEU reserve hosted by Greece. <br/>

The scope of the service request EMSN060 is to evaluate the status of the environment affected by two forest fires that occurred in the summer of 2017 in the Spanish provinces of Huelva and Seville (Andalusia Region). To allow detailed analyses, the affected areas (4,163 ha in AOI 01-Granada de Rio Tinto and 823 ha in AOI 02-El Campillo) were flown to get recent aerial orthoimages (GSD 0.2m, RGB and NIR bands) one year after the event.&nbsp;Fire severity assessmentAssessed by the spectral indices: Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 in six dates from the pre-event and five dates after the fires until recently.&nbsp;Assessment of vegetation recoveryProvides indication of the vegetation restoration in the areas damaged by the forest fires. The product provides the spatial distribution of categorized classes related to vegetation restoration process. Specific parameters as height differences and vegetation cover evolution in the 1-year post-event period were considered. The categorization discriminates maintained, affected and eliminated vegetation classes for three height categories (low &lt;1m, shrubby 1-3m, woody &gt;3), that are complemented with recovery status assessment.Vegetation Volume Change 2015 &ndash; 2018Calculated based on two normalized digital surface models (nDSM) acquired before and after the fire. Vegetation was classified into three height classes. The product provides vegetation height class change inside and outside the affected areas at 2m resolution.Assessment of the observed soil lossThe post-event imagery revealed evidences of soil loss represented by an increase of the runoff and densification of the stream network as expected after the removal of vegetation because of a forest fire. These evidences were registered in a post-event hydrographic vector layer.&nbsp;Additionally, the calculation of the Erosion Coefficient (Z) using the Erosion Potential Method (EPM) was done and compared between pre and post-event situation, providing a qualitative indicator of soil loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of the road network statusThe assessment is focused in comparing the status of the transportation network after the fires with the pre-event conditions. The main objective has been to assess the damages and the improvements on each road, assigning to each mapped road their capability of being circulated.Erosion RiskEvaluated using the Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI) from the Pan-European landslide susceptibility map Methodology ELSUS v2.&nbsp; LSI is expressed as an index (0-1). Results are classified in five categories from very low risk to very high risk.&nbsp;Landslide RiskEvaluated in terms of average of loss of soil (ton ha-1 yr-1) based on empirical RUSLE equation. Results are classified in five categories from very low risk to very high risk, according to the same intervals used in Rediam Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description """This dataset describes the occurrences of 19 species of macroalgae along standardized transects in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica). 
This dataset was based on 2 different campaigns (one in 2016 and one in 2019) in the Bay of Calvi. In both campaigns, an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was deployed in the Bay and navigated along straight transects perpendicular to the coastline. The ROV was equipped with a down-looking GoPro camera, to capture footage of the bottom, and a built-in front-looking camera to capture a general view of the landscape and navigation. Algae were identified and their coverage was quantified using the down-looking videos.

The species of macroalgae are the following : Acetabularia acetabulum, Amphiroa rigida, Caulerpa prolifera, Caulerpa cylindracea, Codium bursa, Colpomenia sinuosa, Corralinales (order), Cystoseira brachycarpa, Cystoseira crinita, Cystoseira spinosa, Cystoseira zosteroides, Dictyota (genus), Flabellia petiolata, Halopteris (genus), Halopteris scoparia, Jania (genus), Osmundaria volubilis, Padina pavonica, Peyssonnelia squamaria.

In this project, each of the "events" represent different transects navigated by the ROV. The points on the map are the location of the beginning of each transect (located on the coast). From this point, the ROV navigated perpendicularly to the coast until the end of the rocky shore. 
The actual geographic position of each algae is not recorded, but only the presence of each algae species along this transect."""@en ;

Attacks by Non State Armed Groups (NSAG) have devastated the town of Rann in North-East Nigeria. With the departure of the security forces, the Non State Armed Groups occupied the town and burnt down a significant number of homes.
The town has been attacked 4 times by Non State Armed Groups since September 2018. After security forces left the town on Sunday 27 January 2019, most of the population left with them, heading towards the nearby town of Goura in Cameroon, where it is estimated that 35 000 people have arrived in need of shelter.
OCHA Nigeria requested satellite images of the towns of Rann and Goura, as well as the area in between, in order to assess the extent of the damage, and identify any temporary shelters which may have been set up.<br/>

    dcterms:description """Knowledge of the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of both endemic and invading vector mosquito species as well as the factors driving change, is missing in Belgium. Acquiring this knowledge is an essential step towards understanding current risk and preparing for future treads. Therefore the objectives of the project MODIRISK (Mosquito vectors of disease: spatial biodiversity, drivers of change, and risk) were (1) to inventory endemic and invading mosquito species in Belgium considering environmental and taxonomic elements of biodiversity (http://www.gbif.org/dataset/6679952f-649b-4888-bd97-00daca4b8cc1) + (Collection), (2) to assess the population dynamics of endemic and invasive mosquito species and their interrelationship (This dataset) (3) to model mosquito biodiversity distribution at a one km resolution in the Benelux, and (4) to disseminate project outputs to the scientific community, end users and the general public.

During the first phase (years 2007-2008), the project focused on the inventory activities; setting–up laboratory experiments for studying life history traits of Culex pipiens in relation to temperature and the first selection of models based on the field results. Whilst during the second phase of the project (years 2009-2010) the focus was on the spatial model building and validation, on the longitudinal study (this dataset) and dynamics of selected indigenous and exotic species that were found during the inventory of the first phase and on more population genetic driven research

The longitudinal studies (2nd phase of the project) were conducted on selected indigenous and exotic species found during the first phase of the project. In total 33682 adult mosquitoes were collected at the four sites with the twelve traps.

The project was coordinated by the Institute of Tropical Medicine (http://www.itg.be/E) in Antwerp."""@en ;

Heavy rainfall and snowfall in the first 10 days of February and subsequent snow-melt and channel clogging have caused floods in central Croatia, principally in the basins of Sava and Kupa rivers. Although the waters in general were declining on 19 February, the counties of Sisak-Moslavina, Karlovac, Zagreb and Lika-Senj remain affected and flooded homes were reported on 18 February in Odra Sisacka. Slovenia and Hungary sent respectively 50 000 and 100 000 sandbags to Croatia to assist the flood counter-measures.<br/>

The purpose of the requested mapping is to generate comprehensive knowledge through performing pre-disaster situation analysis, concerning a potential eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano located near to Goma, capital of North Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo&nbsp;(DRC).The results refer to background information as well as to the assessment of the impact of a potential volcano activity on the surrounding urban agglomerations and infrastructures; detailed Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hazard, exposure and vulnerability. These products intend to support informed decision making of the involved stakeholders with reference to disaster preparedness and disaster management. An evacuation plan has also been produced.The key user of the geospatial information and the related map series is DG ECHO, Emergency Response and Coordination center (ERCC).The DEM product was generated through adequately processing of monostatic Tandem-X couples and a Pleiades panchromatic stereo-pair. The products obtained from SAR and optical data processing, were then fused, using weighting parameters, calculated during the generation process. The result was a detailed DEM with 5 meter grid spacing and a vertical accuracy in Z of 3 meters.DEM&nbsp;The Lava Flow Hazard assessment was determined by performing data analysis based on modified and extended implementations of (i) the QVAST tool for the estimation of volcanic susceptibility and (ii) the Q-LavHa tool for the estimation of the lava flow paths and their convergence, by exploiting probabilistic and deterministic simulation models for evaluating channelled lava flow inundation probabilities from regularly distributed eruptive vents. The processing involved: (i) the study of the historical volcanic activity of the area (analysis of historic eruption fissure and vent locations), (ii) Calculation of a volcanic eruption susceptibility map, obtained through a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) on the basis of Probability Density Function (PDF) Maps and definition of the possible lava eruption areas and (iii) Per pixel (DEM) estimation of lava inundation probability (Q-LavHa tool models).Lava flow hazard map&nbsp;The Transportation Network Vulnerability to disruption was estimated on the basis of (a) the Road capacity, as inferred by the respective taxonomy and (b) the population density.Transportation Network Vulnerability to disruption&nbsp; <br/>

According to the National Institute of Volcanology (INGV) the earthquake was very shallow, only 1 km deep and for this reason it has produced many damages to houses and infrastructures. The most damages have been recorded in the neighbour of the villages of Fleri, Zafferana Etnea, Santa Venerina and Acireale. <br/>

    dcterms:description """Invasive species - Ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) in Flanders, Belgium is a sampling event dataset published by the Research Institute of Nature and Forest (INBO). It contains information on 107 sampling events with 88 validated occurrences of invasive ruddy duck (with 2 extra occurrences reporting on white-headed duck) starting from 2009. These occurrences mainly originate from observations or cullings (through shooting or trapping) of individuals associated with official control actions in Flanders, North Belgium in response to the Bern Convention Action Plan on ruddy duck eradication (Robertson et al. 2015; Bern Convention 2016; Hall 2016). The data are used for feeding the Flemish biodiversity indicator on the progress of ruddy duck eradication. Also, they are used for official reporting to the Bern Convention Action Plan on the eradication of ruddy duck from the Western Palearctic (Bern Convention 2016; Hall 2016) and, as the species is included in the list of invasive species of Union Concern since 2016, for reporting to the EU IAS Regulation (1143/2014) (European Union 2014). The data are also used for research purposes. Here the dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each event: a stable eventID, date and location of observation, and a short description of the sampling protocol (in the event core), supplemented with specific information for each occurrence: a stable occurrenceID, the scientific name and higher classification of the observed species, the number of recorded individuals, sex, life stage, and a reference to the observer and identifier of the record (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/issues

A clear majority of Europeans keeps supporting their country’s membership in the EU. 57% of respondents feel that the EU membership is a good thing for their country, almost as many as before the crisis. Most respondents in all Member States say that EU membership has benefitted their country. Finally, an increasing number of citizens find that things are going in the right direction in the EU (31%, +6 compared to March 2017).\r
\r
The European Parliament also sees an uptick in public opinion. An increase of eight percentage points now sees 33% of all citizens having a positive image of the European Parliament, while 42% of respondents still have a neutral image.\r

Mass displacement has started towards the main regional city Herat: fears are many more will follow having reportedly depleted all assets and protection means. The EU Directorate General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) is very concerned about the lack of basic needs and the high morbidity reported as well as the plight of those that are left in villages affected by the drought.

    dcterms:description """This dataset series shows the distribution map (raster format: geotiff) of Pseudotsuga menziesii. The distribution map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The distribution is estimated by means of statistical interpolation (Constrained Spatial Multi-Frequency Analysis, C-SMFA). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre. See the field Lineage for further information.

These include water catchments/pans, storage reservoirs, pumping stations, berkads, solar stills, soil bunds, &nbsp;stone lines, irrigation networks, pipelines and supporting buildings.Vegetation mapsAnalysis of the impacts of drought mitigation measures on the surrounding vegetation.For the assessment of vegetation vigour and biomass, the temporal frequency of the image acquisitions was considered to be more important than the spatial detail. Vegetation vigour and biomass were therefore analysed for 10 years (2006-2016), based on 10-day composites of MODIS images (250x250m). The focus was on the rainy season from April to June. The average vegetation vigour (fAPAR) and the total accumulated biomass (DMP) over the rainy season were computed.Finally, to assess the impact of the drought mitigation measures taken in the second half of 2015, green area, vegetation vigour and biomass estimates for the 2016 rainy season were compared with the corresponding estimates for 2015. <br/>

The Phenelo algorithm was used to calculate productivity based on seasonal vs. non seasonal vegetation, which involves a calculation of growing season biomass for those vegetated surfaces which exhibited seasonal variations. For each map, the upper and lower 90 percentile were set as maximum and minimum to avoid outliers due to e.g. satellite sensor acquisition error and subsequently the data were scaled between 0 (lower 90 percentile) and 1 (upper 90 percentile) to give a more apprehensive measure of standing biomass.

Hence, the operation of the power generation sector is constrained by the availability of the water resources, as well as the addition of constrains on water resources used for other purposes, such as irrigation, flood control, water supply, agriculture, etc. The optimal utilization of water resources between the water and energy sector is defined under the term water-energy (or water-power) nexus. This study describes the implementation of hydrological LISFLOOD, Medium-Term Hydrothermal Coordination (DispaSET-MTHC) and Unit Commitment and Dispatch (DispaSET UCD) models for detailed analysis of impacts on the SEE regional power system for three different hydrological years. Results were validated based on the available ENTSO-E data for the average hydrological (2015) year. Moreover, calculations on water withdrawal and consumption for cooling of thermal power plants were added. Addition of water stress index (WSI) calculations can determine locations that could experience water scarcity.

The scope of the service request EMSN-071 is to support the fire department and administration of the City of Arnsberg (Hochsauerland County, State North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), with designing pre-event preventive measures, as well as incident coordination, in regards of wildfires that could hit this territory.More than 63% of the town&rsquo;s area is covered by forest, including several large protected areas; forest plays an important economic role in both tourism and the timber-processing business. This is a cause of potential harm to city assets and population due to wildfire risk.Proposed solution and resultsThe Land Use / Land Cover (Product 3) and the Reference cartography (Product 4) are built to be used in the assessment of the Fire Hazard (Product 1) and Fire Exposure (Product 2).The Land Use / Land Cover (Product 3) is classified according to level 4 legend of standard Corine Land Cover. Digitalization was manual and classification was photo-interpreted using DOP orthophotos provided by Cologne Government Regional Office.The Reference cartography (Product 4) shows the main topographic, population, industry, transportation features and points of interest (i.e. hospitals, schools, type of industry or potential sites of industrial accidents). It is based on the integration of already existing sources from different producers and the update of the data to the moment of interest. They are all integrated in the EMSN schema geodatabase and updated by means of visual interpretation of reference pre-event imagery.&nbsp;Product 1&nbsp;: Pre-disaster forest fire hazardIs the result of the integration of six variables that take into account the topography, the fire probability, the vegetation structure and the land use land cover at 5 meters resolution.Product 2: Pre-disaster forest fire exposureThe situation of people, infrastructure, housing, and other tangible human assets located within fire prone areas.The exposure shows the spatial representation and the hazard level assigned to each element of the population, buildings, points of interest, transportation network and associated features, land use land cover and Natura 2000 protected areas.

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

Several sources suggest that the Manila NCR and lower Pampanga river basin, Philippines, has been affected by ground subsidence phenomena impacting settlements and increasing flood risk.The EMS service aims to provide evidence of ground motion patterns in the targeted areas using multi-temporal satellite SAR data analysis &ndash; by persistent scatterers interferometry. Product derived from time series of Sentinel-1 imagery provides insight into localization and extent of sinking zones and severity of phenomena related to estimated motion velocity or different adversary patterns.The ground motion map shows average annual vertical and horizontal ground motion velocities. Furthermore, the vector product provides value-adding features such as temporally coherent targets, comparing annual motion trends and classification of motion dynamics such as motion acceleration.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description """This database was created as preparatory work for the Scientific Opinion on the assessment of dairy cow welfare in small-scale farming systems (EFSA, 2015) to collect data for the description and the categorisation of European Small-Scale Dairy Farms (SSDF) based on size, farming system and husbandry practices and (ii) to analyse the feasibility in SSDF of animal-based measures usually used for intensive farming. The Scientific Opinion was necessary to address specific expectations of consumers on locally produced food and acceptable animal welfare conditions in the context of the EU Strategy for the protection and welfare of animals 2012-2015.\r
\r
The on-farm survey was run to collect data for welfare assessment covering Austria, France, Italy and Spain. A total of 124 farms with up to 75 cows were selected based on three criteria reflecting use of local resources or enrolment in a certification scheme: (1) the type of enterprise (ownership and workers), (2) the use of inputs in the production process, including  the  use  of  local  feed  and  local  breeds,  and  (3)  the  production  type (certification schemes). From 124 dairy farms visited 119 were considered as SSDF. Among the 119 farms included in the survey as non-conventional, some of them had a very small herd size (44 had less than 25 cows and one had only 10 cows) and some of them had more animals (19 farms had between 51 and 75 dairy cows).\r
\r
The database includes 53 continuous and categorical farm descriptor variables, 23 continuous and categorical risk-factor variables and 47 animal-based measures in small-scale farms. The final data model used was based on data collection at farm/herd level, pen level and animal level.\r

The ISO 3166-2 standard has also been used. Where there are differences in the territorial unit types and the ISO code, the legal basis of the country concerned has taken precedence.  An administrative unit is defined for the purpose of administration with a certain degree of autonomy and is country-specific. The administrative unit refers to public administration for which the administrative law is applicable.The administrative territorial unit types must not be confused with the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). The NUTS is delineated according to the population living in the territorial unit and is used in an economical/statistical environment. The administrative territorial unit types must not be confused with the jurisdiction territories designed for the competence area of Courts. In certain countries, the subdivisions may be the same for the administrative, economical, statistical and jurisdiction units.The Atu type authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website. "@en ;

In Belgium, there are different types of driver assistance systems, designed to work in harmony.

Memor-Crocodile gives an automatic warning to the driver
The TBL1 gives an automatic warning to the driver and causes an automatic stop if the train passes a closed signal without authorisation.
 TBL1+ gives a warning to the driver and causes the train to stop automatically, but there is also discrete speed control at certain locations (such as when approaching a signal), which provides protection at risk points. 
The European Train Control System (ETCS) is an automatic train control system that informs, controls and corrects by means of beacons installed in the tracks and a computer system in the train driver's cab. The beacons detect the exact position of the train so that the maximum authorised speed can be determined. The system will also monitor and correct driving errors (by correcting the speed on arrival near a red signal, for example, or by initiating emergency braking).

Through the TEN-T programme (Trans-European Transport Network) and the CEF programme (Connecting Europe Facilities), we have already received financial support from the European Union to secure our railway network with ETCS

The scope of the current activation is the support of Regional Civil Protection of Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy) with geospatial analysis regarding the extent of the recent avalanches and their associated impacts, as well as a pre-event avalanche hazard and exposure of assets and population over the remote locality of Sauris in the province of Udine. Between December 2020 and January 2021 intense snowfalls affected Region Friuli Venezia Giulia. In that period several warnings for avalanche risks were issued in the area. In particular, on 6 January 2021 in the municipality of Sauris, the wet snow caused the detachment of several avalanches with interruption of the road network between mountain towns and possible damages to the electrical infrastructures. As requested by the User, a set of five pre/post-event products was produced over a single area of interest centered on the locality of Sauris.Proposed solution and resultsA reference dataset, including Land Use Land Cover, produced by mean of visual interpretation (Product 1).An avalanche delineation based on the helicopter footage performed right after the event (Product 2).A damage assessment (Product 3) based on the intersection between Products 1 and 2, due to the lack of relevant post-event data.A Pre-event avalanche hazard analysis (Product 4), obtained by a multi-criteria evaluation approach, using natural (topography, snow volume) and Land Cover factors.A pre-event avalanche exposure on assets and population, which corresponds to the spatial juxtaposition of avalanche hazard (Product 5) with the location of Highly Valued Resources and Assets.Reference layers produced over Sauris (Product 1)LULC layers produced over Sauris (Product 1)Avalanche areas delineated as light stripe polygons (Product 2)Pre-event avalanche hazard map (Product 4) <br/>

Since 2015, Yemen has experienced a devastating civil war, resulting, among other things, in physical damage to the building stock and infrastructures. The purpose of the requested mapping is to generate asset damage assessment information for the Aden and Sana&#39;a cities in Yemen, as well as information on their expansion within selected reference periods.Damages&rsquo; AssessmentThe analysis involved photointerpretation of VHR satellite imagery, through comparing pre-conflict (2015) and up-to-date (2018) image datasets and the assignment of a damage severity category (moderate damage, severe damage, destroyed and razed to the ground assets) to each examined asset (building stock, pipelines, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urban Morphology&nbsp;Urban SprawlNight Lights MappingThe information on the light intensity recorded during the night gives an indication on the population night activities, supporting the analysis of human footprint of Aden and Sana&#39;a cities. The analysis is based on the calculation of the Sum Of Lights (SOL) index using VIIRS satellite sensors. In order to understand the effects of the conflict on the socioeconomic development, the analysis is performed: (1) before the beginning of the civil war (2014 until February of 2015), (2) in an intermediate period (end of 2016), and (3) for the third period of the civil war (2018).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>

Yearly emissions might be unable, for example, to adequately reflect heavy pollution episodes, seasonal trends, or any process which is inherently time-dependant, thus undermining the capability to determine the causes and to take adequate mitigation measure. Moreover, chemical transport models (CTMs) require the use of spatio-temporally distributed emission data, to simulate the dynamics of photochemical compounds in the atmosphere and pollution loadings during different periods of the year and during different hours of the day."@en ;

    dcterms:description """This dataset series refers to the information on active fire detection provided by the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS). ▷_How to cite: see below_◁
  

Active fires are located on the basis of the so-called thermal anomalies produced by them. The algorithms compare the temperature of a potential fire with the temperature of the land cover around it; if the difference in temperature is above a given threshold, the potential fire is confirmed as an active fire or "hot spot".
The mapping of active fires is performed to provide a synoptic view of current fires at the global scale. Information on active fires is normally updated 6 times daily and made available in EFFIS within 2-3 hours of the acquisition of the MODIS/VIIRS images.
When interpreting the hotspots displayed in the map, the following must be considered.
1. Hotspot location on the map is only accurate within the spatial accuracy of the sensor.
2. Some fires may be small or obscured by smoke or cloud and remain undetected.
3. The satellites also detect other heat sources (not all hotspots are fires).
4. To minimize false alarms and filter out active fires not qualified as wildfires (e.g. agricultural burnings), the system only displays a filtered subset of the hotspots detected by FIRMS. To this end a knowledge based algorithm is applied that takes into account the extent of surrounding land cover categories, the distance to urban areas and artificial surfaces, the confidence level of the hotspot.

The water quality monitoring network is a combined physico-chemical and biological network, the biological component focusing on macro-invertebrates. The sediment monitoring program produces biological data to assess sediment quality. Both monitoring programs aim to provide index values, applying a similar conceptual methodology based on the presence of macro-invertebrates. The biological data obtained from both monitoring networks are consolidated in the VMM database. The dataset published contains: 283,141 records of 207 observed taxa from 4,152 monitoring sites located on more than 669 different water courses. The data are distributed to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC-BY license.

The data in this sampling event resource have been published as a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A), which is a standardized format for sharing biodiversity data. It contains a core table with the events (23,829 records) and two related extensions with occurrences (305,353) and measurements (109,122). An extension record supplies extra information about a core record. The IPT archives the data and thus serves as the data repository.

    dcterms:description """The DAISIE - inventory of alien invasive species in Europe is a species checklist dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). It contains information on 12,104 taxa (mostly species and mostly introduced) occurring in the wild in Europe since 1500. It covers a broad taxonomic spectrum of terrestrial and aquatic free living and parasitic organisms. The collation of the alien species list is the result of the efforts of the DAISIE (http://www.europe-aliens.org/) project partners and more than 300 collaborators from Europe and neighbouring countries, involved in different fields of expertise and organisations. Here the DAISIE checklist is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, higher classification, and stable taxon identifier (in the taxon core), the vernacular names (in the vernacular names extension), the presence in a specific region, the year of the first introduction (first collection) and/or last assessment/observation in that region, as well as extra information (in the distribution extension), and the habitat, native range, and ecofunctional group (in the description extension). The DAISIE dataset is no longer maintained, but can be used as a historical archive for researching and managing alien plants or compiling regional and national registries of alien species. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/trias-project/daisie-checklist

Original data sources compiled (listed below) are heterogeneous in the sense that they result from surveys performed by a variety of actors : Department officers, citizen observations, external partners. Attention should therefore be paid to the DC term: "CollectionCode” when figuring out the features of a given record. Also, geo-referencing should be carefuly done considering the term ‘FootprintWKT’ when given, as the dataset includes both grid-derived and point data.

Main original data sources are the following :

"Encodage en ligne OFFH" (13085 records) is the core encoding module of the Département de l’Étude du Milieu Naturel et Agricole (SPW – DGARNE - DEMNA). This encoding tool (http://observatoire.biodiversite.wallonie.be/encodage) is used by the department's officers, but also by third-party users registered in the system.

"Enquêtes OFFH"(1746 records) are variants of the previous tool, specifically dedicated to survey exotic or invasive species. These specific surveys, set up by the Cellule interdépartementale Espèces invasives (CiEi), are open to the general public and can be found at :http://observatoire.biodiversite.wallonie.be/enquetes .

"Ecrevisses invasives" (1618 records) is a set of exotic crayfish data compiled and shared by Roger Cammaerts as part of the monitoring of crayfish populations in Wallonia.

All records have been validated by the department experts based on a set of rules relying on pictures, the observer’s taxonomic expertise, ecological relevance or additional information requested to the observer (see DC term :IdentificationVerificationStatus).

This dataset content is under a CC-BY license. Please make sure to quote the Département de l’Étude du Milieu Naturel et Agricole (SPW – DGARNE - DEMNA) if you make any use of the data.

Service Request: The nation-wide asset mapping for Finland provides a detailed regional geospatial dataset for the quick and uncomplicated calculation of potential damages either in the preparedness phase or during the immediate response phase of crises caused by natural hazard events. The concept follows the Basic European Asset Map (BEAM) data model developed under the Copernicus precursor project SAFER (Services and Applications for Emergency Response) and extended in the FP7 project IncREO (Increasing Resilience through Earth Observation).BEAM Finland is a comprehensive dataset comprising of a set of spatialized economic indicator values and a population density value. All economic attributes are expressed in EURO/m&sup2;. By using GIS methods for intersecting BEAM data with hazard intensity information and appropriate vulnerability functions quick regional estimates can be made for exposure of assets and population, damage assessments and cost/benefit analysis.The wall-to-wall map and vector dataset depicts assets for various economic categories as well as for population density. The data are derived by combining socioeconomic data and land use/cover data. Fourteen distinct contributing attributes for the asset mapping are provided (e.g. buildings, households, industry, agriculture, etc.). Assets information is made available not only as a cumulative layer of different types of assets (e.g. private households, industry, commerce, vehicles, agriculture, etc.), but as accessible single contributing layers as well, each of them expressing its value.&nbsp; <br/>

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

The renowned Iguanodons from Bernissart, ambassadors of the Belgian science institute in Brussels, represent a natural history collection currently estimated to hold over 37 million specimens. The roots of the present day collection reach far back in history. It evolved from the Natural History collection of Karel of Lotharingen, governor of The Netherlands (1712-1780) and was part of didactic materials owned by the Central School of the City of Brussels. After the independence of Belgium, the City of Brussels donated the collection to the Belgian Government and became part of the autonomous Royal Natural History Museum in 1846, known as the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences since 1948. Fieldwork by researchers and collaborators, in Belgium and abroad, donations and purchases have been expanding the assets ever since. 
The data presented in this dataset are coming from the DaRWIN database, the collection management tool of the RBINS. Today, DaRWIN manages information on about 550.000 specimens stored in the institute's repositories. This number rises on a daily basis thanks to the continued efforts of curators and their adjuncts that are responsible for maintaining the stored specimens and information.
The dataset is made available on GBIF and covers the complete collection, as well as subcollections within Vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish), Invertebrates (acarines, arachnids, Belgian marine invertebrates, brachiopods, bryozoans, marine chelicerates, cnidarians, crustaceans, echinoderms, molluscs and rotifers) and Entomology (beetles, dipterans, heterocerans, hymenopterans, orthopterans and rhopalocerans)."""@en ;

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

- measures supporting citizen empowerment (‘human-centric data economy’) (i.e. possibilities for empowering citizens and putting them even more in control of their data, building on the General Data Protection Regulation and establishing a human centric data economy);\r
- measures clarifying and potentially further developing rights on co-generated data and business-to-business data sharing (in particular in the context of connected and Internet of Things devices); and\r

Wide areas of South America, especially the Amazonas catchment, currently suffer from a large amount of forest fires. Several states in the Northwest of Brasil are particularly affected. As reported by the Brasilian space agency (INPE), there is an increase in the number of fires of 83 % in 2019, compared to the same period in the preceding year. More than 70.000 fires have been registered so far. Parts of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina are also affected.
This incident is widely described as an international crisis due to the Amazonas rainforests' importance 
for global climate.

The distribution map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The distribution is estimated by means of statistical interpolation (Constrained Spatial Multi-Frequency Analysis, C-SMFA). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre. See the field Lineage for further information.

    dcterms:description """Exotic plant occurrences in Wallonia  is a merged occurrence-only dataset, compiling records of exotic taxa from various floristic data sources covering Wallonia (Southern Belgium). Data compilation, cleaning and validation were performed by the Département de l’Étude du Milieu Naturel et Agricole (SPW – DGARNE - DEMNA), in particular the 'GT-Flore', a working group bringing together plant experts from the department and external collaborators from regional naturalist networks.

The types of primary sources compiled in this dataset are heterogeneous, including specific surveys, citizen observations, digitized collections, etc. Attention should therefore be paid to the "DC term: DataSetName" when figuring out record features. Also, Reference should be made to 'FootprintWKT' for spatial referencing, as the dataset includes both grid-derived and punctual data.

"Flore OFFH and Co" (87 332 records) is the core of the DEMNA database. It covers monitoring carried out by the department officers or by partners under agreement, data from digitization calls, etc.

"Encodage en ligne OFFH" (32 941 records) is the database associated to an online recording system for registered citizens (http://observatoire.biodiversite.wallonie.be/encodage/). The system includes georeferencing facilities and allows users to provide pictures.

"BD Berce du Caucase", "Enquetes OFFH","Rinse", "Inv. Perm. des Res. For.","Natura 2000", "Contrats rivières" are topical surveys, limited in time and/or taxonomically oriented.

All records have been subject to a validation procedure performed by the department experts. Validation rules were based on pictures, observer’s expertise, ecological relevance, or additional information provided by the observer.

This dataset content is under a CC-BY license. Please make sure to quote the Département de l’Étude du Milieu Naturel et Agricole (SPW – DGARNE - DEMNA) if you make any use of the data, using preferably the form 'Origin of the Information: SPW-DGARNE – DEMNA – GT Flore & collaborators'  whenever it is possible.

Additional information is accessible upon specific and motivated request addressed to: http://observatoire.biodiversite.wallonie.be/cmdd/. Please contact the department for additional information about the dataset, about the Walloon 'GT-Flore', or about our biodiversity related activities.

This dataset contains the nutrient concentrations (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, phosphorus) measured on water samples taken in the BPNS between 2011 and 2016. The analysis of nutrients (N and P) is ensured by the national monitoring programme at ten sampling locations that are representative for the surrounding water masses. Based on all 2011-2016 results, the relationship with the salt content was calculated and, for each year, the value derived corresponding to a salt content of 33.5. The surface of the area where the nutrient concentrations exceed the respective thresholds was calculated on the basis of the relationship with the winter salt content and a climatology of the spatial distribution of the salt content (see annex D5 of the Belgian MSFD report). The resulting maps give a good overview of nutrient concentrations in the Belgian zone. In order to take into account the coastal-sea gradient and to illustrate the temporal trends in detail, the concentrations were also evaluated in three different areas of the BPNS: the coastal zone, the territorial zone and the open-sea zone. The long-term trends of nutrient concentrations in the three zones were assessed statistically."@en ;

Monitoring & data recording has been done according to the OSPAR Guideline for Monitoring Marine Litter on the beaches in the OSPAR maritime area (OSPAR, 2010). Besides the number of litter items, the category is also noted. The dataset is characterized by a high variation in the number of items. The data are reported to OSPAR beach litter database.

Possible solutions include increasing the use of satellite monitoring technologies, raising awareness about sustainable agriculture such as low/no-till farming, utilizing crop residue for bio-energy, and recycling biomass to create animal feed and other household products. Interventions to limit the severity of the burning of leaves, crops, and peatlands can be made at the local policy level. As part of this program, the Copernicus EMS RRM was activated with the scope to produce suitable data to explore the issues of forest/wildfires hazards for a test area. The AOI chosen for this cases study is located south of Kremenchuts&#39;ke reservoir near the town of Chyhyryn. Core elements of the activation comprise the analysis and generation of geospatial datasets with respect to historical fire events over a period of 5 years, fire hazard based on a multi-criteria evaluation approach, and the fire exposure of critical infrastructure, assets and population.Analysis and determination of the historic fire events.For historical fire events, the surfaces and corresponding timestamps of fires that occurred were mapped, in the periods of March-April and September-November of 2015-2020. The applied method uses a synergistic approach between: a) the combined use of thermal anomalies (fire radiative power that is used to map Hot Spots (HS), from MIR and TIR bands), and b) burnt areas classification based in reflectance from NIR, SWIR and visible bands (based on freely available Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 HR1 images). The latter was performed using the dNBRs of consecutive S2/L8 data, in conjunction with visual interpretation.Determination of the fire hazard areasThe fire hazard&nbsp;is composed of multiple baseline layers. Factors relating to fuel (LULC), accessibility (e.g. transport), topography, climate, and historical distribution of fire events were considered for the estimation of forest fire hazard. The value ranges of each of factors were standardized between 1 and 10 according to e.g. interviews with the AU, with 1 being low fire hazard and 10 very high fire hazard. The final step comprised the weighting of the relative importance of each of the factors and summing all weighted factors in effect performing a linear weighted averaging in order to weight the relative importance of each input factor.Extraction and interpolation of elements (assets, population) exposed to fire hazardThe fire exposure is based on the result of the fire hazard map. To determine the exposure of critical infrastructure and population, two input layers were created - population density and asset map. The exposure of those assets is determined in a combination with the hazard map. Additional tables illustrate the number, surface and length of exposed assets according to the hazard levels.&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description """The Inventory of alien macroinvertebrates in Flanders, Belgium is a species checklist dataset published by Ghent University. It contains information on 73 alien macroinvertebrate species (mostly crustaceans and molluscs) occurring in Flemish aquatic habitats, from inland lakes to coastal harbours at the North Sea. The inventory is the result of the study Boets et al. (2016) (https://doi.org/10.3391/ai.2016.11.2.03 with occurrence data at https://doi.org/10.15468/xjtfoo) where it was originally published as supplementary material. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, higher classification, and stable taxon identifier (in the taxon core), the year of first introduction and last assessment in Flanders (given as a year range in the event date in the distribution extension), coarse habitat information (in the species profile extension) and the pathway(s) of introduction, native range(s), and invasion stage in Flanders (in the description extension). The dataset can be used for researching and managing aquatic invasions or compiling regional and national registries of alien species. Issues with the dataset can be reported at: https://github.com/trias-project/alien-macroinvertebrates

    dcterms:description """The Saltabel dataset deals with grasshopper and cricket occurrences in Belgium. The data are largely gathered by volunteer naturalists, who also reviewed and digitised data from existing museum and university collections in Belgium. Input in a database, feedback to observers, validation and database maintenance were cared for by a professional employee at the Institute for Nature Conservation (IN). The Saltabel (Salta  Belgium) working group was established in 1989. The purpose of this project was mainly to collect information about the distribution, faunistics and ecology of grasshoppers and crickets in Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.  The working group produced a newsletter which appeared irregularly in the period 1989-2002 with the intention to inform observers about latest findings, interesting observations, ecological research etc., provide feedback to naturalists and to raise awareness about the conservation value of Orthoptera in general. During this periode, the working group was most active and organised annual weekends, in turn organized in Belgium, the Netherlands and sometimes also northern France . These weekends were intended to perform inventories for badly prospected regions and to stimulate knowledge exchange between collaborators. In 1997, a standard work on the grasshoppers and crickets of The Netherlands was published using data from this project (Kleukers et al. 1997). In 2000, a provisional atlas and red lists of grasshoppers and crickets in Flanders , Brussels and Wallonia was published (Decleer et al. 2000), providing the first major output of this faunistic project for Belgium. As a consequence, the interest for grasshoppers and crickets in conservation increased, as these insects became important indicators of natural quality and successful nature management. After this milestone, the working group lost some incentive, the network of volunteers was no longer professionally supported and Saltabel became less active. In 2006, a dedicated survey was organised in Brussels Capital Region through the SaltaBru project, greatly increasing the number of records for this region. More recently, Saltabel became a study group of the Flemish NGO Natuurpunt and the working group revived with numerous activities and a growing number of recorders involved (http://www.saltabel.org). Since 2011, the online encoding platform http://www.waarnemingen.be is promoted and used for online reporting of records. Since 2012, the focus of the working group was put on enhancing the knowledge of threatened species in Flanders, with dedicated surveys prospecting historically known locations of e.g. Stenobothrus stigmaticus, Stenobothrus lineatus and Ephippiger ephippiger. The database described here, however, does not contain these recent records. The Netherlands are currently also working on a new atlas through waarneming.nl (http://www.waarneming.nl/sprinkhaanatlas_start.php).

    dcterms:description """This dataset series shows the Maximum Habitat Suitability (MHS, also known as survivability) map of Pinus sylvestris (raster format: geotiff). The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

The data in this dataset is part of the vegetation-plot data used to feed the model and contains groundwater depending terrestrial vegetation relevées in relation to groundwater levels. Vegetation plot relevés were performed near selected piezometers (WATINA database, groundwater network Flanders) between May and August in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Initially the vegetation surveys were recorded in Turboveg (Hennekens, 1998) and later on moved to INBOVEG, the INBO vegetation plot database. The dataset contains 569 vegetation relevées, recorded during the fieldwork of the NICHE-Vlaanderen project. Relevées contain species coverage data, coverage data for layers, vegetation height and the date of recording. All the vegetation relevées were classified as vegetation types.

    dcterms:description """The Meetnetten - Transects for butterflies in Flanders, Belgium dataset is a sampling event dataset published by the Research Institute of Nature and Forest (INBO). It is part of the Meetnetten.be suite of monitoring networks for priority species in Flanders, in which data are collected at fixed locations using a standardized protocol (https://meetnetten.be). This dataset contains transect data for 8 priority butterfly species, as well as other butterflies observed during sampling. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an eventID, date, location and sampling protocol (in the event core), the cloudiness, temperature, and wind force at the time of the event (in the measurement or fact extension) and for each occurrence an occurrenceID, the number of recorded individuals, status (present/absent) and scientific name (in the occurrence extension). Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/meetnetten-occurrences/issues

Generalized and/or withheld information: as these are sensitive priority species, location information is generalized to 1, 5 or 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells. Original locations are available upon request.

The specific service implementation focuses on the generation of information relating to the horizontal and vertical displacement across the AOI as a consequence of the 28th September earthquake (7.5 magnitude) that hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, triggering a number of aftershocks.The analysis involved satellite SAR imagery (Sentinel-1) processing through an offset tracking technique. Ascending and Descending images were selected, both prior to and after the event. This allowed the generation of&nbsp; horizontal and&nbsp; vertical motion decomposition.North-South earthquake ground displacementEast-West earthquake ground displacementDue to the extent of this particular earthquake&rsquo;s effects and the historical seismic activity in the area, mapping that enables the delimitation of boundaries and range of ground displacement is essential in order to allocate aid resources and manage risks. In this case, the fault line crossing the city of Palu is well identified.Vertical earthquake ground displacementThe core users of the map are humanitarian aid operators, governments and response organizations. Other potential users of the map are Civil Protection authorities involved in in-field operations. The scope of the map production is planning and support to logistics. <br/>

At least seven villages in the region lost road access because of mudslides, while the storm also caused bridges to collapse. The event claimed the lives of several people.<br/>

It contains information on 237 native and non-native species of rust fungi occurring in Belgium. The catalogue is the result of literature review and herbarium inspection of the main public Belgian herbaria, complemented with specimens from private herbaria. The checklist  has been published as three separate volumes by Vanderweyen & Fraiture (2006, 2008 and 2011). Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each rust fungus: the scientific name, higher classification, full bibliographic reference and stable taxon ID (in the taxon core), the occurrence status, whether the species is native or introduced (establishment) and date of first and last recorded observation  in Belgium (given as a date range in the event date in the distribution extension). In the taxon core, we also provide the taxonomic information (scientific name and higher classification) of all 518 recorded host plant species and link those to their pathogenic rust fungus/fungi in the resource relationship extension.

The biodiversity centre of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Benin (IITA) houses together with the IFAN museum at Dakar, Senegal one of the largest collection of insects in West Africa. The geographic scope of the collection is mainly Benin, Nigeria and Togo with additional material from various countries in tropical Africa. It constitutes the largest non-plant biodiversity repository within all research centers of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
The IITA insect collection includes to date more than 370,000 specimens and belongs to the few actives of its kind in the subregion. Roughly 6,000 species from 335 insect families have been identified from the sampled material, of which the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera build the most biodiverse orders with 2300 and 1200 identified species, respectively. On-going research on Diptera focusses mainly on Tephritidae but also on pollinating flies in the framework of a collaborative project (Pollinator Information Network for Two-Winged Insects (PINDIP)) (link to: https://www.pindip.org/) involving several Africa based taxonomic institutions and lead by the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium."""@en ;

The dataset contains over 2.500 dragonfly (Odonata) observations sampled between 2008 and 2014 at the Belgian coast. The dataset includes 34 species. The data are collected for the project PINK (Permanente Inventarisatie van de Natuurreservaten aan de Kust), which was commissioned by the Agency for Nature and Forest in 2007. The project started with the aim of mapping the natural values on the coast in a more systematic way. A first 3-year phase (PINK I) ran from 2008 to 2010, in which the methodology was set up and an initial assessment was conducted. A second phase (PINK II) ran from 2012 to 2014, which was a continuation of the main components of PINK I, with special attention for invasive species and grasshoppers. A third phase (PINK III) is running from 2014 to 2018. This dataset contains Odonata occurrences observed during PINK I and PINK II.

It is described in Maes et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-019-00127-z) and compiled from national species lists and red lists from nearly all European countries to prioritize butterfly conservation actions. It covers all 496 butterfly species recognized by Wiemers et al. (2018) to occur in Europe, and includes the occurrence status for 42 countries, including the Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands), and the red list status for 33 of these. Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, higher classification and taxon identifier (in the taxon core), the occurrence status, red list status and sources this is based on per country or Macaronesian island(group) (in the distribution extension), and the English vernacular name (in the vernacular name extension).

    dcterms:description """In its policy, the European Union intervenes when necessary to prevent conflict or in response to emerging or actual crises. In certain cases, EU intervention can take the form of restrictive measures or 'sanctions'. The application of financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets constitutes an obligation for both the public and private sector. In this regard, a particular responsibility falls on credit and financial institutions, since they are involved in the bulk of financial transfers.\r
\r
In order to facilitate the application of financial sanctions, the European Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of Co-operative Banks, the European Association of Public Banks ("the EU Credit Sector Federations") and the European Commission recognised the need for an EU consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets. The Credit Sector Federations set up an initial database containing the consolidated list. The European Commission subsequently took over this database and is responsible for its maintenance and for keeping the consolidated list of sanctions up-to-date. In this respect, the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) of the European Commission launched a new Web page in June 2017, where the consolidated lists of financial sanctions consisting in freezing of assets are published in different formats (see link below).\r
\r
Disclaimer: While every effort is made to ensure that the database and the consolidated list correctly reproduce all relevant data of the officially adopted texts published in the Official Journal of the European Union, neither the Commission nor the EU Credit Sector Federations accepts any liability for possible omissions of relevant data or mistakes, and nor for any use the database or of the consolidated list. Only the information published in the Official Journal of the EU is deemed authentic.  \r

    dcterms:description """<br/> 
Activation date: 2020-10-19 <br/> 
Event type: Humanitarian <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The scope of the activation is to support the WFP officers with geospatial analysis regarding the agriculture and food security situation and nutrition analysis in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. Due to the inaccessibility of the region caused by on-going armed conflicts, the impact of the conflict needs to be estimated for changes in cropland (loss/gain) and affected population in case of cropland loss. The current activation is an update of EMSN-063, assessing changes between 2020 &amp; 2019 and 2020 &amp; 2010.The process steps followed to implement the analysis are:Generation of NDVI-composite layers per AOI for 2020.&nbsp;Change detection of crop areas was performed using NDVI composite raster layer based on HR imagery data. As single NDVIs provide an indication of the presence of vegetation and its photosynthetic activity, it is not sufficient to distinguish crops from surrounding natural vegetation. Compared to this natural vegetation, cropland is identified by its high changes of NDVI values between the different phases of the vegetation period: Photosynthetic activity of crops are low during the ploughing and sowing period, increase during the growing phase until reaching a maximum value right before the harvest. Once harvested, NDVI values should decrease drastically.&nbsp;​Update and verification of the populated sites layer based on freely available imagery and data.&nbsp;To assess the possible impact of the population affected inside the AOIs, several credited and accurate population datasets that depict the distribution of the population on a global scale, were analysed. WorldPop dataset was the source selected to provide population counts per site. This dataset represent estimates of population counts in wall-to-wall coverage at a 100 m spatial resolution. To allocate the spatially distributed population estimates to each of the population sites, that are spatially represented as a point feature it was necessary to interpolate an area of influence for each one of the 2,616 sites identified in the 5 LGAs of analysis.Interpolation of the population data per populates site applying the Thiessen polygon analysis.&nbsp;Thiessen polygons analysis was performed to determinate the allocations areas per each population site. This method generated several partitions of an area (&quot;catchments&quot;) where any location within these smaller regions is closer to its associated input point than to any other point. Therefore, for each site it was generated an allocation area making possible to allocate the population counts inside it to its corresponding population site.Crop change analysis per populated site based on the NDVI-composite layer between 2020 &amp; 2019 and 2020 &amp; 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of population affected by cropland loss.&nbsp;Comparing the changes from 2010-2020 with 2019-2020, it is clear that more than two thirds of cropland loss occurred before 2019, as more than 70% of the locations considered show no change between 2019 and 2020. Of these, 75% were sites affected by cropland loss over the period 2010-2020, 18% of the sites show no change and only 7% of the sites show cropland increase over the period 2010-2020. It can therefore be assumed that the majority of the sites analysed are still affected by the effects of the cropland loss occurring up to 2019.​ <br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
The specific activation focuses on deepening the analysis concerning the occurrence of floods within a transboundary AOI that corresponds to the Drin catchment area and more specifically to the part that extends into four countries, namely Albania, Kosovo, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro.The service and the products aim to serve the scope of the Drin River Cooperation agreement on sustainable management of water resources in the Drin catchment area through providing information relevant for risk preparedness (hazard, historical floods and economic risk assessment) and sustainable development (economic assets mapping, economic risk assessment).Historical Analysis of Floods&nbsp;Events of 12/2004 - Bar, Cetinje, Danilovgrad, Nicksic, Podgorica, ShkodraComprehensive knowledge of a number of disasters that occurred in the past is provided through the spatial extent of the floods, mainly linked with rainfall, and assessment of their impact on existing assets, as well as information on Land Use/Cover and existing assets and infrastructures.To efficiently support &quot;informed&quot; decisions on flood risk management activities and planning of prevention, protection and preparedness measures, through accounting for the area characteristics, the flood hazard was assessed.Flood Risk Mapping &ndash; Hazard Assessment&nbsp;Towards reducing the adverse consequences of flooding for both population and economic activity, flood Hazard assessment was implemented within the Drin catchment area.Due to the characteristics of the Drin river basin, for the estimation of the maximum flood extent a morphological approach was deployed for the catchment area upstream of Skadar lake (based upon the Flood Susceptibility Index/FSI), while a hydraulic modelling was implemented for the Buna river, within a mainly flat area of the AOI, from the Skadar lake to the Adriatic Sea (TELEMAC-2D model through using a very high-resolution DEM).Flood Risk Mapping - Economic Risk Assessment&nbsp;The overall economic risk assessment was implemented through the use of the&nbsp;RASOR platform. Hazard assessment data, economic assets and vulnerability information were accounted to generate a percentage damage of the single asset types. The economic risk was then evaluated on the basis of the economic value information of the asset type/category per square metre, and the effective area occupied by each category.&nbsp; <br/>

    dcterms:description """FORMIDABEL is a database of Belgian Ants containing more than 27.000 occurrence records. These records originate from collections, field sampling and literature. The database gives information on 76 native and 9 introduced ant species found in Belgium. The collection records originated mainly from the Ants collection in Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS), the ‘Gaspar’ Ants collection in Gembloux and the zoological collection of the  University of Liège (ULG). The oldest occurrences date back from May 1866, the most recent refer to August 2012. FORMIDABEL is a work in progress and the database is updated on a regular basis. Twice a year the database is updated with data from the North and the South of the country. 
The latest version of the dataset is publicly and freely accessible through this url: http://ipt.biodiversity.be/resource.do?r=formidabel. The dataset is also retrievable via the GBIF data portal through this link: http://data.gbif.org/datasets/resource/14697
A dedicated geo-portal, developed by the Belgian Biodiversity Platform is accessible at: http://www.formicidae-atlas.be
FORMIDABEL is a joint cooperation of the Flemish ants working group "Polyergus" and the Wallonian ants working group "FourmisWalBru". The database was created in 2002 in the context of the preliminary red data book of Flemish Ants (Dekoninck et al. 2003). Later in 2005, data from the Southern part of Belgium; Wallonia and Brussels were added. Twice a year the database is updated with data from the North and the South of the country.  FORMIDABEL is a work in progress and the database is updated on a regular basis. The latest version of the dataset is publicly and freely accessible through this url: 
http://ipt.biodiversity.be/resource.do?r=formidabel
All the records in FORMIDABEL are georeferenced through the centroid coordinates of the corresponding UTM 5 Km square. Therefore, the uncertainty of these coordinates is 3.500 meters, the distance between the centre and the corner of the UTM square. 
FORMIDABEL follows the taxonomy of Seifert (2007) for most genera and Radchenko & Elmes (2010) only for the genus Myrmica.

Pre-disaster situation analyses for four locations in Italy: Priolo (Sicilia), Otranto (Puglia), Metaponto (Basilicatta) and Catanzaro Lido (Calabria). All of the AOIs are located on the coast, on the front line of any eventual tsunami. A correct and detailed capture of assets was essential in order to improve and perform detailed response and evacuation programs and&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to minimize casualties in a disaster situation.The scope of the map production is to generate a pre-event reference content and analyses including hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk relating to a Tsunami event. Secondary risks are also considered. Access and evacuation routes as well as mitigation measures with respect to all evaluated risks are proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;EMSN043 results will support the current work of the Italian Civil Protection Department to set up the national early warning system, and help the local administrative authorities in charge of planning.Vulnerability of AssetsThe assessment of vulnerability of assets was based on published bibliography and focused on building features and their attributes. Building footprints had to be digitized using pre-event reference imagery and the attributes related to visible characteristics of buildings coded to assess their vulnerability. Building features used in the assessment are related to physical attributes: number of floors, building materials, shape and orientation and presence of natural or artificial protective barriers. These attributes were translated into scores that are used to determine building vulnerability, structural vulnerability, and the vulnerability of building elements.Evacuation Routes for populationThe identification of potential suitable locations for emergency management activities (evacuation points, safe shelters, and field hospitals, helicopter landing spots, gasoline tanks and communications systems) was performed using a spatial multi criteria analysis and the evacuation routes for population from the affected areas to the safe shelters and the access for emergency and rescue services were calculated using network analysis. Their service areas were calculated based on the road network in terms of distance: 500, 1000 and 1500 metres.Mitigation MeasuresHard structural measures were avoided as much as possible, in order to acheive the optimum&nbsp;&nbsp;environmental integration and taking into consideration the sustainability of the measures. These measures were proposed in the form of structural reinforcements where they already exist (harbours and structures protecting the refinery in Priolo). Some other measures imply public works (rising of road profiles), but their environmental impact is compatible, as the infrastructure already existed.&nbsp; <br/>

The analysis resulted in 277.4 ha burnt, of which 151.6 ha only slightly damaged, 116 ha moderately damaged and 9.8 ha highly damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the fire ravaged inside an unpopulated area. The nearby city of Newcastle falls only with a small part within the boundary of the provided AOI. The vegetation in the burned area consists mainly of heath, pastures, and sparsely vegetated area. The damage to forests was minimal. No buildings and no transportation infrastructure were affected by the fire, except for a few hiking trails. <br/>

In the flat Mekong Delta the ocean tides influence the height of the river for more than 200 km upstream. Can Tho is 80 km from the river mouth and strongly affected by tides.<br/>

    dcterms:description """VIS - 'Reference Freshwater Monitoring’ in Flanders, Belgium is a sample based dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The database is described in Brosens et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.475.8556). The dataset contains over 25,000 fish occurrences sampled between 2013 and 2015 from 246 in inland rivers, streams and canals in Flanders, Belgium. The dataset includes 42 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The data are retrieved from the Fish Information System (VIS), a database set up to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders and are collected in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, certain red lists, and biodiversity research. Additional information, such as measurements, absence information and abiotic data are available upon request. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/vis-freshwater-monitoring-events

Length and weight measurement data of the individual fishes, absence information, occurrence data since 2013, as well as abiotic data of the sampling points (pH, temperature, etc.) are not included in the Darwin Core Archive and are available upon request.

It affects the Genal River Special Conservation Area and the Los Reales Natural Area. The first investigations carried out by the SEPRONA of Guardia Civil indicate that could be deliberate. About 400 people have been evacuated as a precautionary measure and several roads have been cut, including the AP 7 motorway towards Algeciras.

    dcterms:description """Impact assessments for agriculture are partly based on projections delivered by models. Sectoral policies are becoming more and more interrelated. Hence, there is a need to improve the capacity of current models, connect them or redesign them to deliver on an increasing variety of policy objectives, and to explore future directions for agricultural modelling in Europe.

SUPREMA (SUpport for Policy RElevant Modelling of Agriculture) is a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (under grant agreement No 773499 SUPREMA) and that came to address this challenge by proposing a meta-platform that supports modelling groups linked already through various other platforms and networks. 

SUPREMA should help close the gaps between expectations of policy makers and the actual capacity of models to deliver relevant policy analysis. The SUPREMA model family includes a set of ‘core models’ that are already used in support of key European impact assessments in agriculture, trade, climate and bioenergy policies.

One of the work-packages of the project ("Testing the SUPREMA model family") had the objective of testing the SUPREMA model family comparing model outcomes of three applications, including: (i) harmonize baseline assumptions and to the extent possible align baseline projections across models in the platform, and (ii) showcase the potential of the models in the meta-platform to respond to the upcoming and existing policy needs by means of two exploratory policy scenarios. 

This open dataset includes 3 components:
1 - (Baseline scenario) - the harmonized baselines (for 2030 and 2050). Please note that the baseline projections do not take into account the 2020 and possible future effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
2 - (Agricultural policy scenario) - medium-term horizon scenarios aiming comparing different models and/or model combinations, that have a large degree of ‘similarity’ such as joined indicator variables, i.e.: AGMEMOD-MITERRA (combined) modelling tool and the CAPRI model. The main focus was comparing model results in both agronomic and biophysical domains. Two variants of the agricultural policy scenario have been simulated and compared: (i) a CAP greening scenario; and (ii) a sustainable diet scenario. Both scenarios are hypothetical but have been chosen in such a way that the can provide insights in future policy issues as: (i) a further greening of the CAP fits in the policy implementation space as it is included in the ongoing policy reform of the CAP after 2020; and (ii) as increasing consumer awareness about healthy diets and their relation to meat consumption, as well as the footprint/climate consequences are highly relevant with respect to the Green Deal roadmap (December 2019) and the Farm to Fork Strategy (May 2020) documents that have been recently published.
3 - (Climate change mitigation scenario) - scenarios that quantifies the GHG mitigation potential of the EU’s agricultural sector and domestic and global impacts of the EU policy, conditional on different levels of GHG mitigation efforts in the rest of the world. These are obtained through the SUPREMA models CAPRI, GLOBIOM and MAGNET and include scenarios where the EU only takes ambitious unilateral climate action up to scenario where the 1.5 C target is pursued globally

SUPREMA has been coordinated by Wageningen Research with the participation of EuroCARE, Thünen Institute, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Research Executive Agency (REA), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """The Checklist of alien birds of Belgium is a species checklist dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). It contains information on 244 alien birds species occurring or ever observed in the wild in Belgium since 1800 and is is a compilation of different sources: literature (e.g. scientific papers, reports), citizen science portals (e.g. observations.be, waarnemingen.be, the Belgian Rare Birds Committee http://www.belgianrbc.be) and online databases such as DAISIE (DAISIE 2000) or the Global Avian Invasions Atlas (Dyer et al. 2017). Here, the checklist is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, higher classification and stable taxon identifier (in the taxon core), the presence in Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region, as well as the year of the first introduction (first collection) and/or last assessment/observation in Belgium (given as a year range in the event date in the distribution extension), coarse habitat information (in the species profile extension), and the pathway(s) of introduction, native range(s) and degree of establishment in Belgium (in the description extension). The checklist can be used for research, to inform horizon-scanning exercises, to perform risk assessments of alien species, to compile regional and national registries of alien species, to feed biodiversity indicators etc. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/trias-project/alien-birds-checklist

We have released this dataset to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver. We would appreciate it if you follow the GBIF citation guidelines (https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines) when using the data. If you have any questions regarding this dataset, don’t hesitate to contact us via the contact information provided in the metadata or via opendata@inbo.be.

This dataset was published as open data for the TrIAS project (Tracking Invasive Alien Species http://trias-project.be, Vanderhoeven et al. 2017), with technical support provided by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). It is selected as one of the authoritative sources for the compilation of a unified and reproducible checklist of alien species in Belgium (Desmet et al. https://doi.org/10.15468/xoidmd).

The compilation of the checklist was supported by the Short Term Scientific Mission Improving data flows for alien birds in Belgium and drafting a roadmap for alien species citizen science in Romania funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Alien CSI CA17122 - Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (https://alien-csi.eu/)."""@en ;

    dcterms:description "Fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) are one of the most economically important groups of insects in the Afrotropical Region. They cause millions of Euros of damage to fruits and vegetables, and are a major constraint to commercial and subsistence farming in the region. The family Tephritidae includes more than 5000 species worldwide, approximately 1400 species of which develop in fleshy fruits (Norrbom et al 1999). Nearly 250 of these species are capable of achieving pest status by feeding on plants of economic importance (White and Elson-Harris 1992). The Mediterranean fruit fly, or Medfly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), is currently the most important of these pests from an invasive species perspective. Of African origin, it has spread to several other continents where it causes millions of Euros in damage. It also threatens other horticultural areas (such as California and Florida in the USA and regions in eastern Australia) resulting in very expensive detecting and monitoring programmes in these regions. The destructive association of several species with commercially grown fruit and vegetable crops makes them the subject of intensive agricultural research. But fruit flies are also biologically diverse and form a significant part of the biota of any region. Besides the several pest species, the large majority of the true fruit flies are limited to a small number of indigenous host fruits, mainly from trees and shrubs. Most of them are associated with forested areas, and can be used as indicator species for the biodiversity of a given area. In addition, several fruit fly larvae develop in other parts of host plants such as the stems or flowerheads. Fruit flies database is part of the ENBI WP13 feasibility study (Collaborative project between the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, the Royal Museum for Central Africa and the National Botanical Garden.

Activation date: 2021-01-20 <br/> 
Event type: Volcanic activity <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated to support the risk assessment analysis related to the effusive eruption of the La Soufriere volcano, in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, that started on 27th December 2020 and that ended up into an explosive eruption on 9th April 2021.The CEMS RRM STD has been triggered during the effusive phase of the volcano activity to provide a highly detailed post-event DSM to be possibly used to simulate the lava flow pathways, analysing the risk and supporting&nbsp;the emergency management. Nevertheless, given the newer eruption happened during production, on 9 April 2021, this product cannot be used for that scope anymore, but only to represent the surface of the volcano as of 03 March 2021.A post-event P01.2-DSM has been generated by exploiting two COSMO-SkyMed HI acquisitions, and the radargrammetric technique. The final spatial resolution is 15 m, with a vertical geometric accuracy equal to about 13 m (CE90) and a horizontal accuracy equal to about 10 m (RMSE).&nbsp;Figure1.

    dcterms:description """Divorce in Flanders (NL: Scheiding in Vlaanderen) is a multi-actor panel study on relationships, causes and consequences of relationship dissolution, as experienced by (ex-)partners, new partners, children and parents. The currently available data is the result of the first wave of data collection, which took place between 2009 and 2011.
\r
There are currently two groups of datasets, distinguished by the anchor respondents to which they pertain.
\r

\r
The first group, "married/divorced", is oriented around respondents who have either been married once and have never divorced, or have divorced once (and possibly remarried once) before 2009. Insofar possible, a face-to-face interview was conducted with both the anchor respondent and their (ex-)spouse, who is also an anchor respondent. Within this anchor relationship, one target child was selected. If living inside the household and over the age of 10, the child was also contacted for a face-to-face interview. If living outside the household and over the age of 18, the target child recieved a mail questionnaire. Similarly, one parent of each respondent in the anchor relationship received a mail questionnaire, as well as a new live-in partner of a divorced anchor respondent. This gives way to the following datasets concerning the "married/divorced" group:
\r
DiF1 - M&D - Anchors 
\r
DiF1 - M&D - Children in HH 
\r
DiF1 - M&D - Children outside HH 
\r
DiF1 - M&D - Parents 
\r
DiF1 - M&D - New partners 
\r
Also available are three extra datasets. The first contains medatadata on the anchor relationship. The second combines all individual survey data (i.e. of the respondents listed above) and metadata on the anchor relationship. The third also combines all survey data, but distinguishes the anchor data, parent data and new partner data by gender of the anchor respondent. This is indicated by a leading M_ for male anchors and F_ for female anchors. No distinction is made for children, as only one child per relationship is questioned. The dataset also contains metadata on the anchor relationship. This gives way to the following extra datasets concerning the "married/divorced" group: 
\r
DIF1 - M&D - Metadata anchor relationship
\r
DIF1 - M&D - All data (individual) + metadata
\r
DIF1 - M&D - All data (by gender) + metadata
\r

\r
The second group, "recently partnered" is oriented around respondents who have either recently (i.e. 1.5 years prior to the sample selection) married or begun to cohabit. Insofar possible, a face-to-face interview was conducted with both the anchor respondent and their current spouse/partner, who is also an anchor respondent. One parent of each respondent in the anchor relationship also received a mail questionnaire. This gives way to the following datasets concerning the "recently partnered" anchor relationships:
\r
DiF1 - RP - Anchors 
\r
DiF1 - RP - Parents 
\r
Again, there are three extra datasets available. The first contains medatadata on the anchor relationship. The second combines all individual survey data (i.e. of the respondents listed above) and metadata on the anchor relationship. The third also combines all survey data, but distinguishes the anchor data and parent data by gender of the anchor respondent. This is indicated by a leading M_ for male anchors and F_ for female anchors. The dataset also contains metadata on the anchor relationship. This gives way to the following extra datasets concerning the "recently partnered" group: 
\r
DIF1 - RP - Metadata anchor relationship
\r
DIF1 - RP - All data (individual) + metadata
\r
DIF1 - RP - All data (by gender) + metadata 
\r

\r
All DiF data is freely available to all interested parties in English and in Dutch, both within and outside of the scientific domain. After completion of the second wave (expected 2024), the collected data will also be made available here. 
\r

\r
Finally, also available are the codebooks of the various datasets. These are only available in English."""@en ;

\r

\r
A la suite de premières analyses, il s'est avéré que seulement 37% des enfants fréquentant les 5 établissements de la ville résidaient dans la commune. Dès lors une question se posait, qu’est-ce qui pouvait inciter des parents résidant hors Louvain-la-Neuve à scolariser leurs enfants sur le site. Une hypothèse semblait s’imposer, ces parents travaillaient à Louvain-la-Neuve. Cette hypothèse si elle se vérifiait imposerait d’intégrer un autre paramètre dans l’équation, le développement de l’activité économique sur le site de Louvain-la-Neuve et le nombre d’emplois y liés.
\r

\r
Pour répondre à cette question, une enquête a été réalisée auprès des parents dont les enfants fréquentes les écoles de Louvain-la-Neuve."""@en ;

Section: horn solo. Documentation Reference Horns (JB 1-5, MDM, YM, BI) ‘Brave Belgians of the Belle Époque’ is an artistic case study that unravels the paradigm of a flourishing legacy of horn playing in Ghent at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of this lost legacy was enabled by analysis of a comprehensive time capsule of related archival findings, historical instruments and repertoire. Findings were contextualized from the perspective of a modern-day performer, creating a practice- based framework that reflects musical performance and perception, artistic identity and the education of musicians, past, present and future. The result was comprised in a like-named doctoral dissertation to which these datasets are linked. This folder contains a dataset of audio and video and a sound bank material linked to reference horns of the 'Brave Belgians of the Belle Époque' dissertation and the likenamed documenting appendix.\r

    dcterms:description """The State Archives in Brussels (Belgium) hold more than 154,000 original nominal file cards that provide an entry to the collection of individual foreigners' files between 1830 to 1890. The files were transferred to the State Archives in 1948 and cover about 286 meters. They are arranged chronologically according to the opening date. The alphabetically ordered nominal file cards, that contain basic individual details on each foreigner such as name, geographical origin, occupation and file number, constitute the main source to retrieve a person's file.

The archives of the Foreigners Police form a unique and essential source for both genealogical and historical research. In October 2015, the IMMIBEL project 'Outcast or Embraced? Clusters of Foreign Immigrants in Belgium c. 1840-1890' started under the guidance of Dr Bart Willems and Filip Strubbe. The project was funded by the Federal Science Policy Office within the framework of the research program BRAIN-be. The aim of the project was to provide a digitally accessible index to the file cards, so that the Foreigners' files are easier to find and consult. For two years project employee Sarah Heynssens was responsible for coordinating the entry of the data from the file cards into a database.

\r
\r
‘Brave Belgians of the Belle Époque’ is an artistic case study that unravels the paradigm of a flourishing legacy of horn playing in Ghent at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of this lost legacy was enabled by analysis of a comprehensive time capsule of related archival findings, historical instruments and repertoire. Findings were contextualized from the perspective of a modern-day performer, creating a practice- based framework that reflects musical performance and perception, artistic identity and the education of musicians, past, present and future. The result was comprised in a like-named doctoral dissertation to which these datasets are linked.

    dcterms:description """This dataset comprises the data collected for the Sub-state Autonomy Scale (SAS). The SAS is an indicator measuring the autonomy demands and statutes of sub-state communities in kind (whether competences are administrative or legislative), in degree (how much each dimension is present) and by competences (as a function of the extent of comprised policy domains).
\r

\r
Definitions:
\r
-By 'sub-state community', I refer to sub-state entities within countries for which autonomous institutions have been demanded by a significant regionalist or traditional (centrist, liberal or socialist main-stream) political party (>5%) or to which autonomous institutions have been conferred.
\r
-By 'autonomy statutes', I refer to the legal autonomy prerogatives obtained by sub-state communities.
\r
-For 'autonomy demands', I distinguish between the legal autonomy prerogatives demanded by the regionalist party with the highest vote share and those demanded by the traditional party with the largest autonomy demand.
\r

\r
Detailed conceptual presentation: see the Regional Studies article cited below (the open access author version can be found in the files section).

\r
\r
We kept the table structure with its clear column definitions and added new columns, these definitions can be found in the column definitions sheet; some columns do not apply or are not our main focus and thus we kept them empty for now.

\r
\r
The observations sheet contains a description of each tool which also served as basis for several column values in the comparison sheet.

\r
\r
Initially we focus on tools which are dedicated social media harvesting tools. Please note that general web archiving tools such as listed in the table of the Data Together initiative may be used to harvest social media data too.

\r
\r
However, these tools might require a specific setup to cope with the peculiarities of social media data, hence we initially did not include these tools.

Contributions and feedback are welcome and we also envision to contribute results back to the Data Together initiative.

Other issues include party identification, partisan preferences, representations of political efficacy, and the nature and extent of political participation. Perceptions of social class and (economic) welfare, authoritarianism, as well as attitudes towards immigrant workers, political corruption and the environment, are among the other areas studied in these surveys.

    dcterms:description "The aim of this survey is to study the relationship between different forms of collective identification and intercultural relationships of Belgian students registered in urban secondary schools affiliated to both the Flemish and French educational systems. A multi-stage sampling frame was developed to reach variation in school contexts: first multicultural urban areas were identified and second heterogeneous schools within each city were randomly selected. The survey contains information on 64 schools situated in Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia. The survey contains five main themes. The central theme is collective identity. In total six different identities were measured, namely the Belgian, regional and ethnic ones. Furthermore the connectedness with the religious identity was mapped as well as students’ identification with their school and track. A second central theme in the survey was the measurement of intergroup relationships. Four different aspects were mapped namely, stereotypes and prejudice towards ethnic outgroups, attitudes about language use at school and a comprehensive measure about school climate. Teaching practices from the point of view of students is the third central theme in the survey. A fourth central theme was mapping pupils experience and awareness of racism and discrimination. Lastly, psychological attributes such as students’ sense of futility, study involvement and self-esteem were included."@en ;

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

The dataset contains over 7,500 occurrences (25% of which are American bullfrogs) sampled between 2010 until now, in the months April to October. The data are compiled from different sources at the INBO, but most of the occurrences were collected through fieldwork for the EU co-funded Interreg project INVEXO (http://www.invexo.eu). In this project, research was conducted on different methods for the management of American bullfrog populations, an alien invasive species in Belgium. Captured bullfrogs were almost always removed from the environment and humanely killed, while the other occurrences are recorded bycatch, which were released upon catch (see bibliography for detailed descriptions of the methods). Therefore, caution is advised when using these data for trend analysis, distribution range calculation, or other.

<br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
In the late evening of Saturday 23 October 2021, a deep cyclone located in the Ionian Sea, brought heavy and persistent rainfall to the Ionian coast of Sicily and Calabria, mainly around Catania and Syracusa cities. A Red alert was issued by the National Department of Civil Protection. The rain gauge of the municipality of Linguaglossa, recorded over 500 mm in 48 hours. The worst situation was registered in the metropolitan area of Catania and in the municipality of Misterbianco with extensive urban flooding. Road circulation was impeded and several houses invaded by mud and debris. In the municipality of Randazzo, many people have been evacuated due the overflow of the Flascio stream. The National Department of Civil Protection triggered the Copernicus EMS Rapid Mapping Service for First Estimate, Delineation and Grading products.<br/>

The northern territories of Bolivia are regularly affected by massive flooding during the rainy season, which runs from October to April. Departments El Beni and La Paz (northern part) are particularly exposed because of extensive wetlands and the presence of large rivers such as Beni and Mamore. During the past decade, the floods which occurred in 2008 and 2014 appear to be the most significant events. Local authorities express the need to better know the areas prone to floods and vulnerability of populations and infrastructure. Proposals related to protection measures and evacuation plans for the most populated locations (Trinidad, Santa Ana del Yacuma, Rurrenabaque and Guanay) are part of the analysis. <br/>

Activation reason: <br/> 
This activation focuses on post-disaster situation analysis, concerning flood events that occurred from January 18 to January 22, 2017, within two main Sardinia&rsquo;s rivers&#39;&nbsp;flows (Tirso and Cedrino).More specifically it addresses the evaluation of flood risk and related impacts on the use of soil, structure and infrastructure.Flooding At Peak Conditions - Damage AssessmentObserved flood extent mapping was estimated using the available SAR imagery for the Orosei sub AOI, which covered the period between January 4th and January 28th, including pre, peak and post images. This specific layer was used as an input for the modelling of the maximum flood extent product.&nbsp;Damage assessment for the population and POIs for the Orosei AOI, subsequent to the events of January 2017 was evaluated using the RASOR platform (www.rasor.eu).&nbsp;Flood Risk Assessment&nbsp;Hazard&nbsp;maps were directly derived from the official maps of the Piano dell&rsquo;Assetto Idrogeologico (PAI) of the Sardinia Region.The&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;layer was generated automatically, by overlaying the hazard layer with detailed information on population and assets, transportation network, POIs &amp; LULC.The&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;assessment of the exposed elements was calculated by considering specific criteria that characterize flood vulnerability and distinguish urban from non-urban areas.Analytical statistics, displaying the severity of the potential impact to assets and population were also calculated and provided.Transportation Network&nbsp;Vulnerability to disruption&nbsp;was estimated taking into account the following parameters:∙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road capacity inferred by the respective taxonomy (highway, primary, secondary, etc.)∙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proximity to populated places∙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population (residents)∙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of alternative routesThe vulnerability of disruption was estimated for each transport asset and segmented into five discrete classes; very low, low, medium, high and very high. <br/>

    dcterms:description """This dataset series refers to the information on active fire detection provided by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). ▷_How to cite: see below_◁
  

Active fires are located on the basis of the so-called thermal anomalies produced by them. The algorithms compare the temperature of a potential fire with the temperature of the land cover around it; if the difference in temperature is above a given threshold, the potential fire is confirmed as an active fire or "hot spot". 
The mapping of active fires is performed to provide a synoptic view of current fires in Europe and as a means to help the subsequent mapping of burnt fire perimeters. Information on active fires is normally updated 6 times daily and made available in EFFIS within 2-3 hours of the acquisition of the MODIS/VIIRS images.
When interpreting the hotspots displayed in the map, the following must be considered.
1. Hotspot location on the map is only accurate within the spatial accuracy of the sensor.
2. Some fires may be small or obscured by smoke or cloud and remain undetected.
3. The satellites also detect other heat sources (not all hotspots are fires).
4. To minimize false alarms and filter out active fires not qualified as wildfires (e.g. agricultural burnings), the system only displays a filtered subset of the hotspots detected by FIRMS. To this end a knowledge based algorithm is applied that takes into account the extent of surrounding land cover categories, the distance to urban areas and artificial surfaces, the confidence level of the hotspot.

The overall objective of the OFFICAIR project is twofold: firstly, to establish a framework that will provide new knowledge in terms of databases, modelling tools and assessment methods towards an integrated approach in assessing the health risk from indoor air pollution, focusing on modern office buildings; secondly, to support current EU policies, such as the \"Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution\" and the \"European Environment and Health Strategy and Action Plan\". The OFFICAIR database (hosted at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra) on concentrations of key indoor air pollutants observed in modern office buildings was developed based mainly on relevant data obtained during the OFFICAIR campaigns. The database was further enriched with data selected from an extensive review of existing data from the \"European Indoor Air Monitoring and Exposure Assessment Project\" (AIRMEX) with appropriate links to the emissions/sources data stored into the \"BUilding MAterials\" (BUMA) and to the BUilding MAterial and Consumer product (BUMAC) emission databases (developed in the context of BUMA and EPHECT projects respectively)."@en ;

Activation date: 2018-04-25 <br/> 
Event type: Storm <br/> 
 <br/> 
Activation reason: <br/> 
The purpose of the requested mapping is to generate comprehensive knowledge through performing post-disaster situation analysis concerning hurricane Irma (September 2017) over two Caribbean islands: the French part of Saint Martin and Saint Barth&eacute;lemy (FR).Towards the implementation of adequate recovery activities, efficient support and informed decision making of the involved stakeholders, damage assessment and monitoring of the reconstruction activities were performed. The monitoring of the reconstructions covered ten (10) time intervals. The first monitoring exercise, performed during the Stage-1 of the activation, informed on the reconstruction status 6 months after the event (beginning of March 2018). Then, on Stage-2 the level of reconstruction was monitored throughout 2018 and continued along 2019 on Stage-3.Key users of the geospatial information and the related map series are the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale De La S&eacute;curit&eacute; Civile et de la Gestion Des Crises, and the Minist&egrave;re des Outre-mer, D&eacute;l&eacute;gation interminist&eacute;rielle.The reference map shows background information of the AOIs, including physiography, transportation infrastructure, built up areas, commercial, public and private services, etc. The information was generated/updated through photo interpretation of the available orthophotos and further elaborated through using VHR satellite imagery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reference mapA Land Use/Land Cover map was created. The legend is based upon CORINE level 4 categories within the built-up areas and level 3 categories within the remaining areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Land Use/ Land Cover mapThe Damage Assessment map shows the damaged assets, which were assigned a damage severity rate (four categories). In order to establish the damage rate, comparative photo interpretation of optical VHR satellite data, acquired before and after the event, was applied. The evaluation of damage was based upon the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS), 1998, and the JRC damage grading nomenclatures, through accounting for specific characteristics, e.g. the roof conditions, the surrounding area status (fences, vegetation, vehicles and wrecks) and the presence of debris.&nbsp; &nbsp;Damage Assessment mapThe Reconstruction Monitoring maps are a time series of maps showing the status of reconstruction of the damaged assets. The time series started 6 months after the event (March 2018, Stage-1), continued during 2018 (Stage-2) and finalized almost two years later, on July 2019 (Stage-3).To establish the reconstruction rate of the assets, the analysis accounted for indications of interventions such as debris clearance, building demolition, construction activities, new structures, etc. The reconstruction status was assigned per asset on the basis of a comparative photo interpretation using two dates of optical VHR satellite data. Statistics on reconstruction status complete the product.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reconstruction Monitoring maps <br/>

The survivability map is provided for Europe (EU28 plus part of other countries within the spatial extent), computed using the FISE harmonised European dataset of taxa presence/absence (based on the integration and harmonisation of the datasets by European National Forestry Inventories; BioSoil; Forest Focus/Monitoring; EUFGIS; GeneticDiversity). The survivability is estimated as the maximum extension of habitat suitability by means of statistical multivariate similarity analysis (Relative Distance Similarity, RDS) of the bio-climatic conditions where the taxon is observed in Europe (RDS Maximum Habitat Suitability, RDS-MHS). Available years: 2006. The maps are available in the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). FISE is run by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre.

These levels are: "Watch" when a relevant precipitation shortage is observed, "Warning" when this precipitation shortage comes with a soil moisture anomaly, "Alert" when these two conditions are accompanied with an anomaly in the vegetation condition, "Partial recovery" when after a drought episode, the meteorological conditions are recovered to normal but not the vegetation conditions, "Full recovery" when meteorological and vegetation normal conditions are recovered.

A new JRC report illustrates the work of the JRC in building an extensive database of EU facilities producing different categories of bio-based products:

 - bio-based chemicals
 - liquid biofuels
 - bio-based composites and fibres
 - pulp and paper
 - biomethane
 - starch, sugar and derived products
 - timber (sawmills)

The database is accompanied by this online interactive dashboard implemented in the EC Data portal of agro-economics Modelling (DataM) and in the EC Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy.

When exploring the two pages of the dashboard, the user is invited to apply the available filters (product category, feedstock origin, TRL and country) to discover the EU bio-based sector. An additional filter is also provided to identify EU biorefineries, according to the user’s preferred definition of them: facilities producing multiple bio-based products, multiple bio-based product categories, or integrating the production of bio-based products and energy.

This is a living tool. The JRC is planning to maintain it up-to-date as much as possible.

User feedback is very welcome through the mailbox JRC-DATAM@ec.europa.eu to update and improve the dashboard and the dataset behind."""@en ;
