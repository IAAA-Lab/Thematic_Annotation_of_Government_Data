Regarding the sampling, hard bottom samplings were carried out using SCUBA diving. The samples were collected on hard substrates mainly in the upper infralittoral zone (30 to 50 cm below the lowest sea level).

This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the reef habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed. Subtidal rocky reefs were surveyed by diver along relocatable transects at three sites."@en ;

    dcterms:description """This report describes the results from an interdisciplinary field survey aimed at identifying the  location, extent and condition of Annex I habitat features in the Large Shallow Inlet and Bay of The  Wash and North Norfolk Coast SAC.  The habitat features of interest are (i) subtidal boulder and  cobble communities, and (ii) Sabellaria spinulosa reefs.  Information presented is intended to serve  as a baseline for future monitoring of the identified features.  Acoustic sidescan data were acquired from selected areas within the broader SAC area, together  with grountruthing samples representative of distinct acoustic signatures.  Groundtruthing  techniques included the acquisition of video and still images of the seabed and of sediment and  faunal sample. 
     Of particular interest was an  area to the north of the eastern Well survey area between 10 and 47 m deep which exhibited a high  density of hard and rugged features, confirmed as boulder and cobble reef on chalk bedrock by the  photographic record.  This area also harboured a high number of epifaunal taxa not observed in the  surrounding sediments.  The area has been delimited and covers approximately 470 ha.  The acoustic record did not reveal the occurrence of areas of Sabellaria spinulosa reef.  Infaunal  samples did collect representatives of this species but in densities too small to be considered as reef.   At most sites where S. spinulosa was observed, the abundance and diversity of the whole infaunal  assemblage was higher than in areas where S. spinulosa was absent.   Analysis of both infaunal and epifaunal assemblages revealed several distinct communities throughout the survey area."""@en ;

According to the standard form of the SCI, its marine part has an area of 5181.74 ha, i.e. about 45% of its total area, which includes habitat 1110, habitat 1120, habitat 1170 and habitat A5.531.Bottom substrates were surveyed with a DeepVision (DE3468D) portable side scan sonar trawled on the “Saria” vessel with a high precision GPS system. The survey vessel performed a number of transects in the study sub-areas, in most cases parallel to the shoreline and with an overlap of the scanned area of the bottom between two adjacent transect lines. All data were continuously recorded onboard the survey vessel on a computer with the appropriate software systems installed . Additionally, the BlueRobotics, BLUE ROV2 (ver. heavy duty) underwater drone was used for ground truthing of the different habitat types. The sonograms of the scanned area were later used for the creation of substrate type maps of the area. Data analysis was performed with the software products DeepView Pro for the side scan sonar data, and QGIS3.12 for the creation of substrate and overview maps. Data exported in KML format by DeepView and transformed in shape files in QGIS. Polygons of the same habitat were merged so each feature within the shapefile is assigned to each habitat. To ensure that the data will display properly the shapefiles were cleaned by removing any geometry or topology errors. The shape length and area was calculated and all habitats visualized via Geoserver on MedOBIS viewer (https://portal.lifewatchgreece.eu/) in WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326). An OGC standard for geospatial styling (Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD)) was used through Geoserver to create styles for each layer. The Open Street Map was used as a basemap, as it is an updated open source map."@en ;

    dcterms:description "Within the last 5 years, widespread uptake of multi-beam sonar technology within the offshore survey industry has meant that swath bathymetry is becoming economic even within the nearshore region. As a result, the Southeast Strategic Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme has been able to upgrade their single-beam bathymetric surveys to achieve 100% seafloor coverage to IHO Order 1a standard through collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyâ??s Civil Hydrography Programme. Although the main purpose is to survey the bathymetry of the seabed, the full coverage bathymetry combined with acoustic backscatter information collected during the swath bathymetry survey can be integrated with ground-truthing information to produce a series of detailed maps."@en ;

    dcterms:description """Overview:
corine: Landcover sample points

Traceability (lineage):
    This dataset was produced with a machine learning framework with several input datasets, specified in detail in Witjes et al., 2022 (in review, preprint available at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-561383/v3 )

Scientific methodology:
    The single-class probability layers were generated with a spatiotemporal ensemble machine learning framework detailed in Witjes et al., 2022 (in review, preprint available at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-561383/v3 ). The single-class uncertainty layers were calculated by taking the standard deviation of the three single-class probabilities predicted by the three components of the ensemble. The HCL (hard class) layers represents the class with the highest probability as predicted by the ensemble.

Usability:
    The HCL layers have a decreasing average accuracy (weighted F1-score) at each subsequent level in the CLC hierarchy. These metrics are  0.83 at level 1 (5 classes):, 0.63 at level 2 (14 classes), and 0.49 at level 3 (43 classes). This means that the hard-class maps are more reliable when aggregating classes to a higher level in the hierarchy (e.g. 'Discontinuous Urban Fabric' and 'Continuous Urban Fabric' to 'Urban Fabric'). Some single-class probabilities may more closely represent actual patterns for some classes that were overshadowed by unequal sample point distributions. Users are encouraged to set their own thresholds when postprocessing these datasets to optimize the accuracy for their specific use case.

Uncertainty quantification:
    Uncertainty is quantified by taking the standard deviation of the probabilities predicted by the three components of the spatiotemporal ensemble model.

Data validation approaches:
    The LULC classification was validated through spatial 5-fold cross-validation as detailed in the accompanying publication.

Completeness:
    The dataset has chunks of empty predictions in regions with complex coast lines (e.g. the Zeeland province in the Netherlands and the Mar da Palha bay area in Portugal). These are artifacts that will be avoided in subsequent versions of the LULC product.

Consistency:
    The accuracy of the predictions was compared per year and per 30km*30km tile across europe to derive temporal and spatial consistency by calculating the standard deviation. The standard deviation of annual weighted F1-score was 0.135, while the standard deviation of weighted F1-score per tile was 0.150. This means the dataset is more consistent through time than through space: Predictions are notably less accurate along the Mediterrranean coast. The accompanying publication contains additional information and visualisations.

Positional accuracy:
    The raster layers have a resolution of 30m, identical to that of the Landsat data cube used as input features for the machine learning framework that predicted it.

Temporal accuracy:
    The dataset contains predictions and uncertainty layers for each year between 2000 and 2019.

Thematic accuracy:
    The maps reproduce the Corine Land Cover classification system, a hierarchical legend that consists of 5 classes at the highest level, 14 classes at the second level, and 44 classes at the third level. Class 523: Oceans was omitted due to computational constraints."""@en ;

The Unemployment function consists of the following benefits: Special Unemployment Benefit, Unemployment Benefit, Social Assistance Board, Subsidiary Unemployment Assistance, Unemployment Assistance and Unemployment Assistance Tapering.  Spatial ESSPROS data is represented per 1000 population. The data source used to compile the beneficiaries data is the System for the Administration of Social Benefits (SABS) database held by the Department of Social Security. Beneficiaries are grouped according to their ID card number. If a person received a particular benefit more than once in a calendar year, the records show one beneficiary. Beneficiaries obtaining more than one benefit under the same function are counted once. Beneficiaries living abroad are not included in the data."@en ;

Surveys consisted of both broad-scale and fine-scale acoustic techniques, utilising sidescan sonar and multibeam swathe bathymetry, along with a variety of ground-truthing techniques including towed and drop down video/stills and Hamon grab sampling. A Rock dredge was also used at a few stations in order to gather samples of epibiota from hard substrata to assist with the taxonomic identification of the video and still images. The range of sampling techniques employed ensured that any Annex I habitats could be adequately described and  characterised.

    dcterms:description """Overview:
Vegetation tree species sample points

Traceability (lineage):
    This is an original dataset produced with a machine learning framework which used a combination of point datasets and raster datasets as inputs. Point dataset is a harmonized collection of tree occurrence data, comprising observations from National Forest Inventories (EU-Forest), GBIF and LUCAS. The complete dataset is available on Zenodo. Raster datasets used as input are: harmonized and gapfilled time series of seasonal aggregates of the Landsat GLAD ARD dataset (bands and spectral indices); monthly time series air and surface temperature and precipitation from a reprocessed version of the Copernicus ERA5 dataset; long term averages of bioclimatic variables from CHELSA, tree species distribution maps from the European Atlas of Forest Tree Species; elevation, slope and other elevation-derived metrics; long term monthly averages snow probability and long term monthly averages of cloud fraction from MODIS. For a more comprehensive list refer to Bonannella et al. (2022) (in review, preprint available at: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1252972/v1).  

Scientific methodology:
    Probability and uncertainty maps were the output of a spatiotemporal ensemble machine learning framework based on stacked regularization. Three base models (random forest, gradient boosted trees and generalized linear models) were first trained on the input dataset and their predictions were used to train an additional model (logistic regression) which provided the final predictions. More details on the whole workflow are available in the listed publication.

Usability:
    Probability maps can be used to detect potential forest degradation and compositional change across the time period analyzed. Some possible applications for these topics are explained in the listed publication.

Uncertainty quantification:
    Uncertainty is quantified by taking the standard deviation of the probabilities predicted by the three components of the spatiotemporal ensemble model.

Data validation approaches:
    Distribution maps were validated using a spatial 5-fold cross validation following the workflow detailed in the listed publication.

Completeness:
    The raster files perfectly cover the entire Geo-harmonizer region as defined by the landmask raster dataset available here.

Consistency:
    Areas which are outside of the calibration area of the point dataset (Iceland, Norway) usually have high uncertainty values. This is not only a problem of extrapolation but also of poor representation in the feature space available to the model of the conditions that are present in this countries.

Positional accuracy:
    The rasters have a spatial resolution of 30m.

Temporal accuracy:
    The maps cover the period 2000 - 2020, each map covers a certain number of years according to the following scheme: (1) 2000--2002, (2) 2002--2006, (3) 2006--2010, (4) 2010--2014, (5) 2014--2018 and (6) 2018--2020

Thematic accuracy:
    Both probability and uncertainty maps contain values from 0 to 100: in the case of probability maps, they indicate the probability of occurrence of a single individual of the target species, while uncertainty maps indicate the standard deviation of the ensemble model."""@en ;

Data on wind speed and direction were delivered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and averaged over a 10-year period (i.e. 1995-2004). The model is run using the program WaveImpact based on the method “Simplified Wave Model” (SWM) developed and described by Isæus (2004). The method is a fetch model, where the fetch values are adjusted to simulate refraction and diffraction effects. The estimated fetch values for each of the 16 directions are multiplied with the average wind speed in the given direction. 

The model has been run by NIVA for the whole Norwegian coast, and has been used as part of the habitat modelling of the National program for mapping biodiversity – coast (Bekkby et al. 2013). The model has also been applied in several research projects in Norway (e.g. Bekkby et al. 2008, 2009, 2014, 2015, Bekkby & Moy 2011, Norderhaug et al. 2012, 2014, Pedersen et al. 2012, Rinde et al. 2014).

Defra Natural Environment Group Science Division (CRO 361) made a significant contribution to this work. The work contributed to the MESH project that received European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIb Community Initiative. The aims of the survey were to acquire high resolution multibeam, sub-bottom profiler and seabed imagery data in the SW Approaches area, located approximately 320km southwest of Land's End. The cruise not only mapped the variable morphology of the area, but also investigated the biological communities within the canyon system for the assessment of a potential SAC under the EC Habitats Directive. The cruise also tested the application of the survey standards and protocols developed under the MESH project. The cruise was the first thorough test for the recently completed MESH Guidance Framework, providing a 'proof of concept' from planning to completion."@en ;

The Family/Children function contains the following benefits: Marriage Grant, Maternity Benefit, Maternity Leave Benefit, Re-marriage Grant, Children's Allowance, Foster Care Allowance and Social Assistance for Single Parents.  Spatial ESSPROS data is represented per 1000 population. The data source used to compile the beneficiaries data is the System for the Administration of Social Benefits (SABS) database held by the Department of Social Security.

The survey vessel performed a number of transects in the study sub-areas, in most cases parallel to the shoreline and with an overlap of the scanned area of the bottom between two adjacent transect lines. All data were continuously recorded onboard the survey vessel on a computer with the appropriate software systems installed . Additionally, the BlueRobotics, BLUE ROV2 (ver. heavy duty) underwater drone was used for ground truthing of the different habitat types. The sonograms of the scanned area were later used for the creation of substrate type maps of the area. Data analysis was performed with the software products DeepView Pro for the side scan sonar data, and QGIS3.12 for the creation of substrate and overview maps. Data exported in KML format by DeepView and transformed in shape files in QGIS. Polygons of the same habitat were merged so each feature within the shapefile is assigned to each habitat. To ensure that the data will display properly the shapefiles were cleaned by removing any geometry or topology errors. The shape length and area was calculated and all habitats visualized via Geoserver on MedOBIS viewer (https://portal.lifewatchgreece.eu/) in WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326). An OGC standard for geospatial styling (Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD)) was used through Geoserver to create styles for each layer.

This model covers the entire Norwegian coast and parts of the adjacent seas, and the technical details are described in Albretsen et al. (2011). At the surface the ocean model applied atmospheric fields from a high-resolution simulation with the WRF meso-scale wind model (www.wrf-model.org<http://www.wrf-model.org/>, Dudhia, 1993). The model statistics were retrieved from two separate simulations covering the period from January-August both in 2013 and 2014. Tidal forcing was retrieved from the global TPXO model of ocean tides (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002) and added along the open boundary in addition to daily averaged surface elevation, currents and hydrography from the operational forecast from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.

Regarding the sampling, hard bottom samplings were carried out using SCUBA diving. The samples were collected on hard substrates mainly in the upper infralittoral zone (30 to 50 cm below the lowest sea level). For the study of the soft bottom habitats, oceanographic cruses were carried out with the IMBC R/V “Filia”, using a Smith McIntyre sediment sampler."@en ;

These polygons were mapped and merged to collate inter-tidal seagrass surveys originally assessed as part of the Water Framework Directives suite of Biological Quality Element tools. The data collected can also be used to inform the habitat map as it corresponds to the Eunis code 'A2.611-Mainland Atlantic Zostera noltii or Zostera angustifolia meadows'.

Surveys undertaken by Quercus at Queen's University, Belfast on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland (DOE).

Subsequently translated into EUNIS habitat classification scheme."""@en ;

    dcterms:description """Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CMACS) Ltd were contracted by Natural England to carry out feature condition monitoring on intertidal features within the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation (SAC) which encompassed Chichester Harbour, Langstone Harbour, Southampton Water, West Solent and the northern coast of the Isle of Wight. 
      
     Surveys were based around transects with a 400m wide corridor (i.e. 200m either side of the transect) and with locations for target notes placed at 50m intervals within the survey corridor.  Surveys were carried out on foot where the intertidal area was small and/or firm underfoot and from a hovercraft where soft sediments were present. 
      
     Target notes and photographs of visible flora and fauna were supplemented with 0.01m2 core samples consisting of five faunal replicates and a further one for particle size analysis (PSA), as well as 1m2 quadrats dug out to 20cm to aid biotope classification.  Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. 
      
     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. 
      
     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. 
      
     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.  Soft, fine sediments were also encountered on the western side of Southampton Water from Calshot to Hythe with a fauna dominated by Tharyx killariensis but with large numbers of cockles and Hydrobia ulvae near Calshot itself. 
      
     On the seaward side of Calshot, to western side of the Beaulieu Estuary, there were coarse mixed sediments which supported ephemeral algae, small actiniarians, and a rich fauna of polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs.  There was also a large seagrass bed on the lower shore at Calshot and evidence of bait digging in these areas, particularly at Lepe Beach.  Within the Beaulieu and Lymington Estuaries the habitats were fine, soft sediments with a similar fauna to the mud areas of Chichester and Langstone Harbours but with a greater prevalence of ragworm and tellins. 
      
     The north coast of the Isle of Wight was characterised by protrusions of clay and outcrops of bedrock which supported piddocks and a rich crustacean fauna as well as a variety of macroalgae predominantly fucoids.  In addition, the habitats of Thorness Bay included mixed coarse sediment supporting barnacles and littorinids and sand supporting sand mason worms and small patches of seagrass beds.  The very sheltered areas of Newtown Harbour and the Medina Estuary where typically mud habitats with cockles and thick algal mat but also with some mixed sediments mid estuary which supported cockle, sponges and littorinids."""@en ;

Categories were delineated according to relative levels of protection, from the highest to the lowest: fishing closures implemented by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and marine reserves; other MPAs likely to benefit from a lower protection; and Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs). Source vector data originated from the RFMOs (NAFO, NEAFC and GFCM), the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), national MPAs databases (US: NOAA and SAFMC; Canada: Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Norway: Institute of Marine Research) and the CBD website. The relative cover or each protection category on 25km *25km gridsquares was computed. This dataset was built to feed a basin-wide spatial conservation planning exercise, targeting the deep sea of the North Atlantic. The goal of this approach was to identify conservation priority areas for Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and deep fish species, based on the distribution of species and habitats, human activities and current spatial management."@en ;
